[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need.

[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 2. Amount of foods refers to how much food is eaten at each meal. It is important to eat foods in the appropriate amounts, again to ensure that we are not getting too little or too much food.

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Citrus fruits are very good but we don’t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.

Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The most important dietary source is iodized salt. Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains.

[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids.

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources.

[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg.

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food.

[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Discourage processing practices that contaminate the agricul- ture harvest. - Promote good storage practices that ensure safe and nutri - tious foods. - Not all food should go to the market.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.

[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Avoid taking raw or partially cooked foods of animal origin. - All food grains and seeds such as maize and groundnuts should be properly dried and stored in a dry place. Use clean stores for storing foods.

[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Keep cooked food away from contact with raw food. - Avoid eating mouldy or rotten food. - Avoid taking oil seeds whose skin has been cracked, e.g., ground - nuts, soybeans.

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Avoid physical or mechanical damage during harvesting, transportation and handling of foods. - Avoid drying, shelling, threshing and winnowing food on bare ground (problems with contamination by microorganisms, sand and stones). - Sort and clean the food to remove diseased and poor quality produce and impurities.

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Street foods, food vending, restau-rants and hotels have become quite common of recent. Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels: - Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites - Biological toxins such as mycotoxins - Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones - Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, copper and others Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause of food poisoning in the world. Physical aspects of food items affected by microbial activity with potential toxin formation include the following: - Discoloration - Mouldy and other unpleasant tastes - Production of off odour Aflatoxins caused by the moulds of aspergillusspp are especially asso - ciated with occurrence of liver cancer in humans.

[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.

[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease.

[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg.

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight.

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food.

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.

However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous.

[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) If you introduce any food before six months you will poten-tially expose the baby to unsafe and poor quality meals. Exclusive breastfeeding refers to feeding a child on breast milk only for the first six months. Mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies as many times as the baby demands to be fed (at least 8 times a day, every 2-3 hours).

[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total). Breastfeeding mothers should also take a lot of fluids to cater for the high amounts of water used to make breast milk. They should avoid self-medication, smoking and alcohol to prevent intoxicating the baby.

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Pregnant women should take iron and folate tablets daily in addition to foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin A. KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a breastfeeding mother take a balanced diet and in addition to 3 meals daily receives 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby. - A pregnant woman and breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the main food groups daily.

One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight.

One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need.

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Water requirements Drink water everyday especially in hot weather when much is lost through sweating to avoid dehydration. A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult).

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids.

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources.
