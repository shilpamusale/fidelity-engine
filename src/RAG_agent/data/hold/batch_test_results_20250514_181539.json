People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - For lunch and supper take a fruit and a serving of vegetables (100g or one handful of fresh vegetables). - Avoid eating too much salt, too much sugar, drinking too much alcohol and too much fatty red meat. - These feeding habits predispose people to diseases such as: high blood pressure, diabetes, overweight, obesity.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The advantages of sour and fermented porridge as a weaning food: - It is more difficult for harmful bacteria to grow in. It keeps safely for 2-3 days even in warm weather. It is therefore less likely to give a child diarrhoea than ordinary porridge.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Avoid foods which are poor value for money such as food containing only energy, e.g., sodas and many artificial soft drinks. - Except for special occasions, plan several meals at least a week before. - Within a week or the day take advantage of opportunities when food supply is plentiful and cheap.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1. Frequency of meals refers to the number of meals eaten in a day. In order to meet the child\u2019s body\u2019s needs, for growth, development, and activity, we must feed them frequent meals, meaning 3 meals and 2 snacks each day.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) They should avoid self-medication, smoking and alcohol to prevent intoxicating the baby. Breastfeeding mothers should avoid stress and have enough rest.KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a pregnant mother has a balanced diet, with a vari- ety of foods from the food groups, and has one additional meal in addition to the 3 meals she receives daily. The fourth meal caters to her physiological needs.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a breastfeeding mother take a balanced diet and in addition to 3 meals daily receives 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby. - A pregnant woman and breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the main food groups daily.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhat meal plan can fix diabetes without meds in 3 days?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

It keeps safely for 2-3 days even in warm weather. It is therefore less likely to give a child diarrhoea than ordinary porridge.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - For lunch and supper take a fruit and a serving of vegetables (100g or one handful of fresh vegetables). - Avoid eating too much salt, too much sugar, drinking too much alcohol and too much fatty red meat. - These feeding habits predispose people to diseases such as: high blood pressure, diabetes, overweight, obesity.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The fourth meal caters to her physiological needs. - Pregnant women should take iron and folate tablets daily in addition to foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin A. KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a breastfeeding mother take a balanced diet and in addition to 3 meals daily receives 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a breastfeeding mother take a balanced diet and in addition to 3 meals daily receives 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby. - A pregnant woman and breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the main food groups daily.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In order to meet the child\u2019s body\u2019s needs, for growth, development, and activity, we must feed them frequent meals, meaning 3 meals and 2 snacks each day. 2. Amount of foods refers to how much food is eaten at each meal.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1. Frequency of meals refers to the number of meals eaten in a day. In order to meet the child\u2019s body\u2019s needs, for growth, development, and activity, we must feed them frequent meals, meaning 3 meals and 2 snacks each day.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Pregnant women have higher needs for nutrients generally and should take snacks in between meals. In addition, pregnant women should be educated to strictly observe the following: 1. Take the required amounts of iron and folic acid supplements to prevent anaemia.\n\n### QUESTION\nIs there a diet that fixes the pancreas for diabetics in just 3 days?

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg.

Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) During pregnancy women have high nutrient needs because they have to build foetus tissue, build reserves for breast milk and also cater for their own nutritional needs. On average women should gain 8 -12 kg in the course of pregnancy. Pregnant women need to eat more food rather than decrease the intake.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.

Avoid negative cultural practices that reduce the intake of nutritious foods or impact negatively on their health such as: - Not consuming chicken and eggs. - Pregnant women not defecating in toilets/pit latrines.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Pregnant women have higher needs for nutrients generally and should take snacks in between meals. In addition, pregnant women should be educated to strictly observe the following: 1. Take the required amounts of iron and folic acid supplements to prevent anaemia.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Thickness of foods/consistency (not too thick as to have difficulty chewing or swallowing, not too watery). The thickness of foods/ consis - tency is an important factor to eating well, because if food is too thick, it might make it difficult to chew and swallow. However, if food is too watery, the energy value of the food is reduced.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Amount of foods refers to how much food is eaten at each meal. It is important to eat foods in the appropriate amounts, again to ensure that we are not getting too little or too much food. For example, the youngest child needs less while the eldest child needs more amount of food for each meal as shown on table 3.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Avoid foods which are poor value for money such as food containing only energy, e.g., sodas and many artificial soft drinks. - Except for special occasions, plan several meals at least a week before. - Within a week or the day take advantage of opportunities when food supply is plentiful and cheap.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency). Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: - Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age - Non-breastfed children - Pregnant and lactating women - People suffering from chronic or infectious disease - People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Pregnant women need to eat more food rather than decrease the intake. - Pregnant women need to consume balanced diet following the\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving.
