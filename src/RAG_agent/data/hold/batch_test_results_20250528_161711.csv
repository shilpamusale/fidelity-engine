[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The most important dietary source is iodized salt. Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains.

[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids.

It helps the body.Headaches, tiredness, irritability, pale colour, dizziness, anaemia Calcium Milk, cheese and other dairy foods, green leafy vegetables, such as cabbage and okraHelps build strong bones and teeth. Helps muscles and nerves function normally.

Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources.

[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg.

Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food.

[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status.

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) One of the leading causes of maternal death at childbirth is insufficient blood. During pregnancy women have high nutrient needs because they have to build foetus tissue, build reserves for breast milk and also cater for their own nutritional needs. On average women should gain 8 -12 kg in the course of pregnancy.

[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Water is essential for life because it forms part of the body cells and fluids, such as blood and digestive juices. Water requirements Drink water everyday especially in hot weather when much is lost through sweating to avoid dehydration. A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person.

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat.

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults.

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories.

[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight.

[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body. Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits.

[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources.

Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids.

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers32 Picture 6: Examples of a variety of the locally available foods from the three main food groupsAn example of a mixed meal guide to achieve a balanced diet SUMMARY - Eat a lot of whole cereals and beans or legumes generally, if you can’t afford animal protein and as much as possible take some milk in your meals. - Eat a variety of food types from different main three groups (energy giving, body building and protective foods) at a very meal. - For lunch and supper take a fruit and a serving of vegetables (100g or one handful of fresh vegetables).

[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) During pregnancy women have high nutrient needs because they have to build foetus tissue, build reserves for breast milk and also cater for their own nutritional needs. On average women should gain 8 -12 kg in the course of pregnancy. Pregnant women need to eat more food rather than decrease the intake.

Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) This form of malnutrition cannot be identi- fied easily except in advanced stages when clinical signs appear. Minerals and vitamins are required by the body in very small quantities, they are very important in protecting the body against infections. Usually, their absence in the diet does not cause a person to “feel hungry.” Micronutrient deficiency disorders of public health significance in Uganda are: - Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) - Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) - Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) - Zinc deficiency disorder (ZDD) c) Overnutrition This is the excessive intake of nutrients in foods over a given period of time exposing individuals to poor health.

[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) It is important to eat foods in the appropriate amounts, again to ensure that we are not getting too little or too much food. For example, the youngest child needs less while the eldest child needs more amount of food for each meal as shown on table 3. 3.

[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels: - Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites - Biological toxins such as mycotoxins - Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones - Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, copper and others Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause of food poisoning in the world. Physical aspects of food items affected by microbial activity with potential toxin formation include the following: - Discoloration - Mouldy and other unpleasant tastes - Production of off odour Aflatoxins caused by the moulds of aspergillusspp are especially asso - ciated with occurrence of liver cancer in humans. There is also growing evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and undernutrition.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings. Food safety is the protection of consumers from injury or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adul - terated or badly stored foods. Generally, food safety describes the handling, preparation and storage of food in ways that prevent food

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings. Food safety is the protection of consumers from injury or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adul - terated or badly stored foods.

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The majority of the market participants in the food industry are not aware of food safety issues and this is increas- ingly exposing the population to unsafe food consumption. - Current practices of food production, postharvest handling, process- ing, packaging, transportation, retailing and food preparation in the homes, street food vending and some restaurants may lead to food becoming unsafe for consumption. - Food safety related illnesses and problems such as cancer preva-lence are now a common occurrence in Uganda.

[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food safety is a public health priority because millions of people world - wide fall ill every year and many die as a result of eating unsafe food. Importance of food safety in Uganda - As the country develops, an increasing percentage of the population is eating food prepared from outside the home or at least processed away from home. The majority of the market participants in the food industry are not aware of food safety issues and this is increas- ingly exposing the population to unsafe food consumption.

[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and when taken or eaten nourishes the body. Food safety The protection of consumers from injury or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adulterated or badly stored foods. Food safety describes the production, handling, preparation and storage of food in a way that prevents foodborne illnesses.

One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need.

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Water requirements Drink water everyday especially in hot weather when much is lost through sweating to avoid dehydration. A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult).

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids.

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources.
