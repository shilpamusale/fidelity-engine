One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The most important dietary source is iodized salt. Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) It builds muscles and brain. It helps the body.Headaches, tiredness, irritability, pale colour, dizziness, anaemia Calcium Milk, cheese and other dairy foods, green leafy vegetables, such as cabbage and okraHelps build strong bones and teeth.

This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day.

This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food.\n\n### QUESTION\nI'm planning a diet that's 90% protein to quickly build muscle.

Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults.

Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time.

Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults.

Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains. Other minerals involved in various body functions are chromium, copper, fluoride, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, potas- sium, phosphorus, sodium and selenium.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity). - Infection and diseases such as malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, acute respiratory infections, measles and worm infestations.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Overnutrition may be caused by any of the following factors: - Eating habits (overeating) - Health conditions - Taking too many unprescribed dietary supplements - Lack of physical activity (sedentary lifestyle) - Psychological factors (stress) - Environmental factors (unsafe foods, e.g., heavy metals in food, peer pressure) - Medication - Genetic factors\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - High intake of factors like phytates and tannins that inhibit nutrient absorption. - Food insecurity. Underlying causes include: - Household food insecurity including poor access to a diverse diet, inadequate quantity of food available and accessible, and seasonal fluctuations in food availability.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhat causes poot wound healing\n\n### ANSWER\n",

There is also growing evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and undernutrition.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Street foods, food vending, restau-rants and hotels have become quite common of recent.

Importance of food safety in Uganda - As the country develops, an increasing percentage of the population is eating food prepared from outside the home or at least processed away from home.
