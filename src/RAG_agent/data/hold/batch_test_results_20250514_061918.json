There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers69dren contributing to child malnutrition, child and maternal mortality and bad pregnancy outcomes such as obstructed labour, premature birth and low weight babies. - Men dominate the marketing of farm produce and control incomes there from farm produce income, men are more likely to buy non- food items.

It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency). Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: - Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age - Non-breastfed children - Pregnant and lactating women - People suffering from chronic or infectious disease - People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: - Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age - Non-breastfed children - Pregnant and lactating women - People suffering from chronic or infectious disease - People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food. Undernutrition is the most common and easily observable type of malnutrition. Undernutrition often presents itself in two forms: acute and chronic.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers20Prevalence of malnutrition in Uganda Malnutrition is one of the main public health and economic and devel - opment problems facing Uganda. Children below the age of five years and women in reproductive age including pregnant women and lactating mothers are mostly affected (UDHS 2011). Children below the age of 5 years suffer mostly from under nutrition with: - 33% of these children suffer from chronic undernutrition (they are stunted) - 14% are underweight (body weight too light for their age) - 49% suffer from iron deficiency anaemia (lack of iron/blood) - 60% suffer from different forms of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) Likewise women in reproductive age (15 -49 years) also suffer from malnutrition: - 52% of pregnant women and lactating mothers have vitamin A defi- ciency - 23% suffered from iron deficiency anaemia Figure 1.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers19b) Micronutrient malnutrition (lack of minerals and vitamins) This type of malnutrition is called \u201chidden hunger;\u201d and is due to inad - equate intake of dietary mineral salts and vitamins leading to vitamin mineral deficiencies (VMDs). This form of malnutrition cannot be identi- fied easily except in advanced stages when clinical signs appear. Minerals and vitamins are required by the body in very small quantities, they are very important in protecting the body against infections.\n\n### QUESTION\nIs 'inadequate maternal and childcare' identified as an underlying cause of malnutrition in the handbook?

Mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies as many times as the baby demands to be fed (at least 8 times a day, every 2-3 hours).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) SUMMARY - Exclusive breastfeeding is the safest and healthiest way to feed a baby for the first 6 months. - Babies need to be breastfed 8-12 times a day after every 2-3 hours or more as needed, in the first six months. - Mothers should continue to breast feed their babies up to the age of 2 years or more even after introducing complemen- tary feeding (weaning).\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Helps the mother to shrink the uterus back to its normal size. - Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months helps a child\u2019s mental (brain) development. SUMMARY - Exclusive breastfeeding is the safest and healthiest way to feed a baby for the first 6 months.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Breast milk is the best food for babies and is all the baby needs up to six months of age. Children from birth to six months of age should be exclusively breastfed. If you introduce any food before six months you will poten-tially expose the baby to unsafe and poor quality meals.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers39Weaning/complementary feeding practices Weaning is the gradual introduction of food into the diet of the child. Alongside breast milk at the age of six months, beyond 6 months, breast milk alone is not enough to meet the child\u2019s increased nutritional needs for proper growth and development. During weaning there are six princi - ples to follow: meal frequency, amount, thickness, variety, active feeding and hygiene.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers36 Picture 7: A pregnant woman and a breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the food groups, extra meals and take iron and folate daily. Nutrition for children 0 to 6 months Breastfeeding and complementary feeding behaviours are important predictors of infant and child nutrition, health and survival. Breast milk is the best food for babies and is all the baby needs up to six months of age.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers42Picture 11: A mother encourages and supervises her child\u2019s feeding following the six principles of complementary feeding practice from the age of 12 -24 months. KEY MESSAGES - From 6 months and beyond, children should be fed on other foods on top of the mother\u2019s breast milk. Milk should form the foundation of the child\u2019s diet between the ages of 0 to 2 years.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers35Nutrition for breastfeeding mothers Nutritional requirements during breastfeeding are higher than during pregnancy because the mother has to produce enough milk to sustain a baby (bigger than the foetus) for the first six months and beyond. Breast - feeding women need to eat a wide variety of foods. Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total).\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers37Picture 8: A mother breastfeeding her baby and hand expressing her milk to leave for the baby when she is away.KEY MESSAGES - A baby from birth to 6 months of age should be fed only on breast milk and no other milk or foods. - A breastfeeding mother should take a balanced diet and in ad - dition to 3 meals daily should eat 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.

Give food daily according to age, for example: - 6-8 month: feed 2-3 times a day - 9-11 month: feed 3-4 times a day - 12-24 month: feed 4-5meals a day\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers37Picture 8: A mother breastfeeding her baby and hand expressing her milk to leave for the baby when she is away.KEY MESSAGES - A baby from birth to 6 months of age should be fed only on breast milk and no other milk or foods. - A breastfeeding mother should take a balanced diet and in ad - dition to 3 meals daily should eat 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers84- If necessary, increase the amount of food and the number of meals that the child eats. - Increase the length of time between breast feeds, so that the num - ber of breast feeds decreases gradually. - Apart from those times when you decide to breastfeed, avoid situa - tions that make the child think of breastfeeding for example, having the child on her lap if she sits down to eat or to have a drink.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Encourage the mother to systematically stop breast feeding by following the steps below: - Make sure that the child continues to feed well at least four to five times a day.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers36 Picture 7: A pregnant woman and a breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the food groups, extra meals and take iron and folate daily. Nutrition for children 0 to 6 months Breastfeeding and complementary feeding behaviours are important predictors of infant and child nutrition, health and survival. Breast milk is the best food for babies and is all the baby needs up to six months of age.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - The absorption of non-haem iron, zinc and some other minerals is increased. Suggestions for stopping the child from breast feeding Complete withdrawal of a child from breast milk should be a slow and gradual process. Encourage the mother to systematically stop breast feeding by following the steps below: - Make sure that the child continues to feed well at least four to five times a day.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers35Nutrition for breastfeeding mothers Nutritional requirements during breastfeeding are higher than during pregnancy because the mother has to produce enough milk to sustain a baby (bigger than the foetus) for the first six months and beyond. Breast - feeding women need to eat a wide variety of foods. Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total).\n\n### QUESTION\nTrue or false: The handbook recommends 'breastfeed 8\u201112 times per day'.\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Promotion of market oriented agriculture has resulted in increased production; however limited emphasis has been placed on reducing postharvest losses and increasing shelf life to ensure availability during lean periods.\n\n### QUESTION\nIs quinoa classified as a staple cereal in the handbook?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2.

A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities. SUMMARY - Train farmers to articulate their nutrition related needs during the planning process.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhat food processing practice helps prevent aflatoxin contamination according to the handbook?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2.

A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their products. - Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods. - Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean.

Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs. - Foods rich in proteins such as insects (grasshoppers, white ants, caterpillars, termites) should be promoted. - Encourage kitchen gardens and growing of fruits as part of local gov - ernment bylaws.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1) Pr oduction of a v ariety of cr op and animal sour ce f oods f or nutri - ent-dense diet. The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their products. - Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods. - Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean.

Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2.

A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their products. - Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods. - Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean. Foods rich in pro- tein from animal source (those which can easily be kept by women or children for consumption or sold in the market to earn cash for household health expenditure without exciting men to resist). These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs. - Foods rich in proteins such as insects (grasshoppers, white ants, caterpillars, termites) should be promoted. - Encourage kitchen gardens and growing of fruits as part of local gov - ernment bylaws.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1) Pr oduction of a v ariety of cr op and animal sour ce f oods f or nutri - ent-dense diet. The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs. - Foods rich in proteins such as insects (grasshoppers, white ants, caterpillars, termites) should be promoted. - Encourage kitchen gardens and growing of fruits as part of local gov - ernment bylaws.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1) Pr oduction of a v ariety of cr op and animal sour ce f oods f or nutri - ent-dense diet. The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their products. - Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods. - Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean.

Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2.

A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their products. - Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods. - Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean. Foods rich in pro- tein from animal source (those which can easily be kept by women or children for consumption or sold in the market to earn cash for household health expenditure without exciting men to resist). These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs. - Foods rich in proteins such as insects (grasshoppers, white ants, caterpillars, termites) should be promoted. - Encourage kitchen gardens and growing of fruits as part of local gov - ernment bylaws.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1) Pr oduction of a v ariety of cr op and animal sour ce f oods f or nutri - ent-dense diet. The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2.

A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics.

They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their products. - Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods. - Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean. Foods rich in pro- tein from animal source (those which can easily be kept by women or children for consumption or sold in the market to earn cash for household health expenditure without exciting men to resist). These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs. - Foods rich in proteins such as insects (grasshoppers, white ants, caterpillars, termites) should be promoted. - Encourage kitchen gardens and growing of fruits as part of local gov - ernment bylaws.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1) Pr oduction of a v ariety of cr op and animal sour ce f oods f or nutri - ent-dense diet. The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs. - Foods rich in proteins such as insects (grasshoppers, white ants, caterpillars, termites) should be promoted. - Encourage kitchen gardens and growing of fruits as part of local gov - ernment bylaws.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1) Pr oduction of a v ariety of cr op and animal sour ce f oods f or nutri - ent-dense diet. The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their products. - Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods. - Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean.

Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity.

They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their products. - Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods. - Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean.

Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2.

A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk. When severe, presents with visible wasting (promi - nence of bones) and/or symmetrical swelling of the body starting from both feet. 2) Chronic malnutrition: Stunting A child\u2019s height is one of the most important indicator of his/her well- being.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhat is one immediate consequence of malnutrition mentioned in the handbook?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their products. - Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods. - Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean. Foods rich in pro- tein from animal source (those which can easily be kept by women or children for consumption or sold in the market to earn cash for household health expenditure without exciting men to resist). These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs. - Foods rich in proteins such as insects (grasshoppers, white ants, caterpillars, termites) should be promoted. - Encourage kitchen gardens and growing of fruits as part of local gov - ernment bylaws.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1) Pr oduction of a v ariety of cr op and animal sour ce f oods f or nutri - ent-dense diet. The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2.

A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics.

They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their products. - Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods. - Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean. Foods rich in pro- tein from animal source (those which can easily be kept by women or children for consumption or sold in the market to earn cash for household health expenditure without exciting men to resist). These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) These include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs. - Foods rich in proteins such as insects (grasshoppers, white ants, caterpillars, termites) should be promoted. - Encourage kitchen gardens and growing of fruits as part of local gov - ernment bylaws.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1) Pr oduction of a v ariety of cr op and animal sour ce f oods f or nutri - ent-dense diet. The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk. When severe, presents with visible wasting (promi - nence of bones) and/or symmetrical swelling of the body starting from both feet. 2) Chronic malnutrition: Stunting A child\u2019s height is one of the most important indicator of his/her well- being.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhat is one immediate consequence of malnutrition mentioned in the handbook?\n\n### ANSWER\n",
