It helps the body.Headaches, tiredness, irritability, pale colour, dizziness, anaemia Calcium Milk, cheese and other dairy foods, green leafy vegetables, such as cabbage and okraHelps build strong bones and teeth. Helps muscles and nerves function normally.

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids.

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources.

[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food.

[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers59- Clean and sort to remove broken kernels, foreign matter, and diseased and rotten foods (grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables); these attract mois - ture and pests leading to spoilage and/or fungal growth. - Ensure crops are properly dried immediately after harvesting; howev - er, drying will not reverse the effect of poison in the already contam- inated foods, but it may inhibit further growth of moulds and other microbes. Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic).

[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.

[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels: - Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites - Biological toxins such as mycotoxins - Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones - Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, copper and others Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause of food poisoning in the world. Physical aspects of food items affected by microbial activity with potential toxin formation include the following: - Discoloration - Mouldy and other unpleasant tastes - Production of off odour Aflatoxins caused by the moulds of aspergillusspp are especially asso - ciated with occurrence of liver cancer in humans. There is also growing evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and undernutrition.

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings. Food safety is the protection of consumers from injury or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adul - terated or badly stored foods.

Food safety is the protection of consumers from injury or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adul - terated or badly stored foods. Generally, food safety describes the handling, preparation and storage of food in ways that prevent food

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Discourage processing practices that contaminate the agricul- ture harvest. - Promote good storage practices that ensure safe and nutri - tious foods. - Not all food should go to the market.

[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Street foods, food vending, restau-rants and hotels have become quite common of recent. Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels: - Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites - Biological toxins such as mycotoxins - Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones - Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, copper and others Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause of food poisoning in the world.

[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) This includes a number of routine activities that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards. Food safety is a public health priority because millions of people world - wide fall ill every year and many die as a result of eating unsafe food. Importance of food safety in Uganda - As the country develops, an increasing percentage of the population is eating food prepared from outside the home or at least processed away from home.

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) If crops are kept on damp floors or in pits (even in bags) or humidity rises above 80 per - cent, the likelihood of Aspergillus growth and aflatoxin production is very high. - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households.

Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body’s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight.

[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

A serving is a quantity of food suitable for or given to one person in one meal.

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Consumption of animal source foods is necessary for a family to achieve a balanced diet. - Animal source foods are a good source of readily digested protein and are rich in energy. Animal source foods are easily absorbable and an efficient source of micronutrients (calcium and B12 from milk, and iron, zinc and vitamin A).

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) We now know that each food serves the body differently (“GO”, “GLOW”, “GROW”), therefore it is important to have a variety of foods from each food group in order to eat well. Use fortified foods, when available; give vitamin/mineral supplements when animal products, fortified foods, or micronu - trient (vitamin A, Fe & Zn) rich foods are not readily available. 5.

[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) SUMMARY - Exclusive breastfeeding is the safest and healthiest way to feed a baby for the first 6 months. - Babies need to be breastfed 8-12 times a day after every 2-3 hours or more as needed, in the first six months. - Mothers should continue to breast feed their babies up to the age of 2 years or more even after introducing complemen- tary feeding (weaning).

[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Babies need to be breastfed 8-12 times a day after every 2-3 hours or more as needed, in the first six months. - Mothers should continue to breast feed their babies up to the age of 2 years or more even after introducing complemen- tary feeding (weaning). Give food daily according to age, for example: - 6-8 month: feed 2-3 times a day - 9-11 month: feed 3-4 times a day - 12-24 month: feed 4-5meals a day

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months helps a child’s mental (brain) development. SUMMARY - Exclusive breastfeeding is the safest and healthiest way to feed a baby for the first 6 months. - Babies need to be breastfed 8-12 times a day after every 2-3 hours or more as needed, in the first six months.

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) If you introduce any food before six months you will poten-tially expose the baby to unsafe and poor quality meals. Exclusive breastfeeding refers to feeding a child on breast milk only for the first six months. Mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies as many times as the baby demands to be fed (at least 8 times a day, every 2-3 hours).

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Mothers should continue to breast feed their babies up to the age of 2 years or more even after introducing complemen- tary feeding (weaning). Give food daily according to age, for example: - 6-8 month: feed 2-3 times a day - 9-11 month: feed 3-4 times a day - 12-24 month: feed 4-5meals a day

[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Encourage the mother to systematically stop breast feeding by following the steps below: - Make sure that the child continues to feed well at least four to five times a day.

[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - A breastfeeding mother should take a balanced diet and in ad - dition to 3 meals daily should eat 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby.

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a breastfeeding mother take a balanced diet and in addition to 3 meals daily receives 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby. - A pregnant woman and breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the main food groups daily.

[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.

[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status.

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (“GO” foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or “GO” foods.

Iron needs are highly increased partly due to the need to build reserves for child up to six months after birth before initiating complementary food intake. - Pregnant women need to take foods rich in calcium, e.g., milk and mukene (silver fish) partly to take care of the increased requirement for building the foetus skeletal structure.

[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) In addition, pregnant women should be educated to strictly observe the following: 1. Take the required amounts of iron and folic acid supplements to prevent anaemia. 2.

[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) - Pregnant women should take iron and folate tablets daily in addition to foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin A. KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a breastfeeding mother take a balanced diet and in addition to 3 meals daily receives 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby. - A pregnant woman and breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the main food groups daily.

[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total). Breastfeeding mothers should also take a lot of fluids to cater for the high amounts of water used to make breast milk. They should avoid self-medication, smoking and alcohol to prevent intoxicating the baby.

[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook) During pregnancy women have high nutrient needs because they have to build foetus tissue, build reserves for breast milk and also cater for their own nutritional needs. On average women should gain 8 -12 kg in the course of pregnancy. Pregnant women need to eat more food rather than decrease the intake.
