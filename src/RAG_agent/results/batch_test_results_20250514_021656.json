Minerals of public health importance Iron is an essential component of blood and helps transfer oxygen to various body tissues. Dietary sources include red meat, fish, poultry (easily absorbed), legumes, leafy green vegetables (less easily absorbed, but absorption increases if eaten with animal source iron or vitamin C). Calcium is a key component of bones and teeth and is needed for a strong skeleton and important in blood clotting. The major source of calcium in the world is milk and milk products. Other sources include fish eaten with bones (silver fish\u2014mukene, haplochromis species\u2014nkeje) and dark green vegetables (plant sources are not well absorbed). Iodine is important for thyroid function and for mental development of children. The most important dietary source is iodized salt. Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains. Other minerals involved in various body functions are chromium, copper, fluoride, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, potas- sium, phosphorus, sodium and selenium. Mineral requirements Minerals that are required by the body in relatively large amounts such as calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, sodium and magnesium require deliberate efforts to be supplied them through increased food production, consumption and supplementation. Most trace mineral elements such as iodine copper, manganese, fluo - rine, cobalt, nickel, zinc, chromium and selenium are supplied by a wide variety of foods and the body is unlikely to be deficient in them when one consumes a balanced diet.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 19) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers8KEY MESSAGE Promote production and consumption of fruits in all households as part of the broad iron deficiency anaemia prevention strategy.- Legumes such as beans, peas, and pigeon peas, among others. - Fruits such as mangoes, oranges, and pineapples, among others. 2) Micronutrients These are required by the body in small amounts and include: vitamins and minerals. Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron bioavailability from plant food sources.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 22) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers11FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS Vitamin A (Retinol)Yellow/orange fruits and vegetables, DGLV, egg yolk, liver, milk, blue-band/ margarineSupports immune system and provides resistance to infections, ensures good vision, healthy skin, teeth and bone development, promotes maintenance of epithelial cells and mucous membranesEye problems and night blindness, sensitivity to light, scaly and skin and hair, poor teeth and nails, colds Vitamin D Produced by the skin on exposure to sunlight Milk, cheese, butter, blue band margarine, fatty fish eggs and liverRequired for proper formation of bone and teeth Helps the body to absorb calcium and phosphorusPoor absorption of iron and phosphorus will lead to formation of weak bones and teeth, growth of children is retarded severe deficiency leads to rickets and osteomalacia in adults/elderly Vitamin E Vegetable oils, nuts and seeds, whole grains, eggs, legumes, DGLVIncreases disease resistance, Protects fats and vitamins A and C from oxidation, prevents agingTiredness, dry hair, leg cramps, infertility, muscle weakness, impotence, nerve problems and heart disorders Vitamin K Vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, cauliflower, and cabbage, broccoli, fish, liver, meat, eggsHelps with blood clottingBleeding\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 94) The advantages of sour and fermented porridge as a weaning food: - It is more difficult for harmful bacteria to grow in.

Suggestions for stopping the child from breast feeding Complete withdrawal of a child from breast milk should be a slow and gradual process. Encourage the mother to systematically stop breast feeding by following the steps below: - Make sure that the child continues to feed well at least four to five times a day.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it. What is malnutrition? Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency). Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: - Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age - Non-breastfed children - Pregnant and lactating women - People suffering from chronic or infectious disease - People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food. Undernutrition is the most common and easily observable type of malnutrition. Undernutrition often presents itself in two forms: acute and chronic.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 96) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers85Annex 4. Uganda Nutrition Advocacy Messages (PROFILES) The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition-related illnesses or deaths in their families. The country losses about US$34 million worth of productivity because of iron defi-ciency anaemia among adults. Women of reproductive age with anaemia accounted for 75 percent, or US$25 million, of that loss. The total loss estimated at about 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product/GDP . Stunting in early childhood affects productivity in adulthood. For every 1 percent that the height of a child under 2 years of age is below the norm, the child\u2019s productivity from manual labour as an adult declines by 1.4 percent. Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting. These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009). Vitamin A deficiency, which affects mainly women and children in Uganda, increases the risk of blindness and susceptibility to diseases, mainly diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in children. Children with vitamin A deficiency are 1.4 times more likely to die of these and other childhood illnesses than ones that are not deficient. Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili - ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent. Because of IDD, in the year 2009 alone, 2,100 children were born as cretins in Uganda and likely will require 100 percent care in their entire lives, 59,000 children were born with mild or moderate mental disabil - ities and Uganda lost US$8.6 million in productivity (Uganda Profiles 2012).\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 21) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers10WATER-SOLUBLE VITAMINS (CONTINUED) Vitamin B3 (Niacin)Fish, meat, chicken, eggs, whole grain cerealsEnables energy production in the body, supports appetite and central nervous system functions - Dermatitis - Dementia - Diarrhoea Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)Legumes, avocado, dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), whole grains, nuts and seeds, cabbage, banana, liver, chicken, meat, fish, potatoes, water melon, sun flowers seedsFacilitates metabolism and absorption of fats and proteins, promotes red blood cells formation, production of protein and nerve transmitters, antioxidantsTiredness, anaemia, irritability, depression, sore tongue, nausea, muscle twitching, dizziness, dermatitis (skin problem), neuropathy (nerve problem) Vitamin B 12 (cyanocobalamin)Seafood, liver, kidney, heart, whole grains, tuna, yoghurt, eggs, cheese, meat, chickenFormation of red blood cells, affects white blood cells, maintains nerve and gastrointestinal tissueTiredness, anaemia, confusion, numbness, nerve problems, ringing in ears, dementia, memory problems Folic acid Kidney, liver, nuts, legumes, eggs, green vegetables, whole grains, avocado, oranges, fishContributes to synthesis of new red blood cells and gastrointestinal cells, aids cell division and growthDiarrhoea, sore red tongue, anaemia, heartburn, fatigue, confusion, depression and dementia Vitamin C Guavas, sweet pepper, leafy green vegetables, oranges, lemons, tomatoes, most fruitsBuilds healthy bones, teeth and gums, helps fight infection, helps non-heme iron absorption, serves as an antioxidants, helps in protein metabolismBleeding gums, bruise easily, slow heal, anaemia, muscle and joint pain, frequent colds\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 94) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers83Annex 3. Ways of Boosting the Nutritive Value of Porridge How to further boost nutritive value or food value of porridge - Add vegetable oil to porridge improve its energy value. - Add eggs, milk to improve protein. - Use of flour made out of sprouted and dried cereal grains like millet. The presence of amylase partially digests the complex and bulky carbohydrates and makes the porridge more energy dense. - Add fruit juices like lemon, oranges, lime etc. just before serving porridge increases vitamin C value, palatability/ taste and enhances absorption of nutrients. Porridge made from fermented cereals or legumes reduce incidence of diarrhoea during weaning. Addition of juice from fruits (ascorbic acid) to porridge greatly enhances absorption of minerals like iron and improves the taste. Such food preparation methods should be encouraged in the communities. The advantages of sour and fermented porridge as a weaning food: - It is more difficult for harmful bacteria to grow in. It keeps safely for 2-3 days even in warm weather. It is therefore less likely to give a child diarrhoea than ordinary porridge. - It is thinner and easier for a baby to eat and digest than plain por - ridge. - The absorption of non-haem iron, zinc and some other minerals is increased.\n\n### QUESTION\nIs iron poorly absorbed from food?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Water is essential for life because it forms part of the body cells and fluids, such as blood and digestive juices. Water requirements Drink water everyday especially in hot weather when much is lost through sweating to avoid dehydration. A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat. - To enable body processes such as digestion. - To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and cool. - To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water. Extra water is needed: - During illness when a raised temperature results in increased sweat - ing. If vomiting or diarrhoea has occurred, both of which can cause dehydration especially in babies. - In lactation when extra water is required for milk production. After intensive activity such as sport.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 18) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers7Fat/lipid/oil requirements Fat provides high amounts of energy to the body; 1 g of fat produces over 9 kcals. Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 51) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers406. Food Hygiene. Proper hygiene practices will prevent disease occur - rences and hence ensure good child growth and development: washing hands before eating and handling foods, clean utensils and clean water. This is a very important factor needed for eating well. Good hygiene reduces the risk of diseases. Table 4.

Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 6) 38 Weaning/complementary feeding practices .......................................................... 39 CHAPTER FIVE: WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PRACTICES (WASH) .......... 43 Water access ........................................................................................................... 43 Water quality .......................................................................................................... 43 Hand washing .......................................................................................................... 44 Food hygiene ........................................................................................................... 44 Kitchen and housekeeping ...................................................................................... 46 Proper refuse disposal ............................................................................................ 47 Sanitation ................................................................................................................ 47 CHAPTER SIX: AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION ................................................................... 50 A) PLANNING FOR NUTRITION FRIENDLY AGRICULTURE: NEEDS IDENTIFICATION ...................................................................................................... 51 Keys considerations ................................................................................................ 51 B) NUTRITION SENSITIVE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION PRACTICES ...................... 53 C) NUTRITION CONSIDERATIONS IN HARVEST AND POSTHARVEST HANDLING ....57 Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage ................................................. 58 Cleaning ..................................................................................................................\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 46) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers35Nutrition for breastfeeding mothers Nutritional requirements during breastfeeding are higher than during pregnancy because the mother has to produce enough milk to sustain a baby (bigger than the foetus) for the first six months and beyond. Breast - feeding women need to eat a wide variety of foods. Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total). Breastfeeding mothers should also take a lot of fluids to cater for the high amounts of water used to make breast milk. They should avoid self-medication, smoking and alcohol to prevent intoxicating the baby. Breastfeeding mothers should avoid stress and have enough rest.KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a pregnant mother has a balanced diet, with a vari- ety of foods from the food groups, and has one additional meal in addition to the 3 meals she receives daily. The fourth meal caters to her physiological needs. - Pregnant women should take iron and folate tablets daily in addition to foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin A. KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a breastfeeding mother take a balanced diet and in addition to 3 meals daily receives 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby. - A pregnant woman and breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the main food groups daily.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 49) - Helps the mother to shrink the uterus back to its normal size. - Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months helps a child\u2019s mental (brain) development. SUMMARY - Exclusive breastfeeding is the safest and healthiest way to feed a baby for the first 6 months. - Babies need to be breastfed 8-12 times a day after every 2-3 hours or more as needed, in the first six months. - Mothers should continue to breast feed their babies up to the age of 2 years or more even after introducing complemen- tary feeding (weaning). Give food daily according to age, for example: - 6-8 month: feed 2-3 times a day - 9-11 month: feed 3-4 times a day - 12-24 month: feed 4-5meals a day\n\n### QUESTION\nHow much water should I drink every day?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.

Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes.\n\n### QUESTION\nHow much protein do I need if I don\u2019t work out?\n\n### ANSWER\n",
