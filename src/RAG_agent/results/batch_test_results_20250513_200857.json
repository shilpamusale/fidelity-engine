Thickness of foods/consistency (not too thick as to have difficulty chewing or swallowing, not too watery). The thickness of foods/ consis - tency is an important factor to eating well, because if food is too thick, it might make it difficult to chew and swallow. However, if food is too watery, the energy value of the food is reduced. 4. V ariety of diff erent f oods from each food group. In session 2 we learned about the food groups and their importance. We now know that each food serves the body differently (\u201cGO\u201d, \u201cGLOW\u201d, \u201cGROW\u201d), therefore it is important to have a variety of foods from each food group in order to eat well. Use fortified foods, when available; give vitamin/mineral supplements when animal products, fortified foods, or micronu - trient (vitamin A, Fe & Zn) rich foods are not readily available. 5. Activ ely f eed and support is important, particularly for PLHIV. This is more than just feeding PLHIV (both adults and children), but involves a number of actions to support PLHIV to have access to food, grow foods, and prepare these foods.\n\n### QUESTION\nquestion\n\n### ANSWER\n",

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body. Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits. A serving is a quantity of food suitable for or given to one person in one meal. Moderation means keeping servings reasonable. This involves self- control and addresses the aspect of too much food intake that leads to becoming overweight and obese.\n\n### QUESTION\nA serving of almonds is a whole cup, right?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron bioavailability from plant food sources.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 22) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers11FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS Vitamin A (Retinol)Yellow/orange fruits and vegetables, DGLV, egg yolk, liver, milk, blue-band/ margarineSupports immune system and provides resistance to infections, ensures good vision, healthy skin, teeth and bone development, promotes maintenance of epithelial cells and mucous membranesEye problems and night blindness, sensitivity to light, scaly and skin and hair, poor teeth and nails, colds Vitamin D Produced by the skin on exposure to sunlight Milk, cheese, butter, blue band margarine, fatty fish eggs and liverRequired for proper formation of bone and teeth Helps the body to absorb calcium and phosphorusPoor absorption of iron and phosphorus will lead to formation of weak bones and teeth, growth of children is retarded severe deficiency leads to rickets and osteomalacia in adults/elderly Vitamin E Vegetable oils, nuts and seeds, whole grains, eggs, legumes, DGLVIncreases disease resistance, Protects fats and vitamins A and C from oxidation, prevents agingTiredness, dry hair, leg cramps, infertility, muscle weakness, impotence, nerve problems and heart disorders Vitamin K Vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, cauliflower, and cabbage, broccoli, fish, liver, meat, eggsHelps with blood clottingBleeding\n\n### QUESTION\nDoes microwaving vegetables destroy all their vitamins?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat. - To enable body processes such as digestion. - To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and cool. - To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water. Extra water is needed: - During illness when a raised temperature results in increased sweat - ing. If vomiting or diarrhoea has occurred, both of which can cause dehydration especially in babies. - In lactation when extra water is required for milk production.

The ideal storage consists of dry, impermeable spaces kept at low temperature. If crops are kept on damp floors or in pits (even in bags) or humidity rises above 80 per - cent, the likelihood of Aspergillus growth and aflatoxin production is very high. - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.

Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 7) 67 F) GENDER DIMENSIONS IN AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ..................................... 68 Summary of common agricultural projects or actions linked to nutrition ............ 71 ANNEXES ........................................................................................................ 73 Annex 1.

However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.

Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.

If the animals or animal products are released for human consumption before the drug withdrawal period is over, the drug or its metabo - lites is still in the animal/animal product and when consumed may lead to drug resistance in human or failure to respond usual human drug treatment. - Animal products are highly perishable and germs easily multiply in them so should be properly handled and cooked before consump - tion. - Provide information/guidelines on the effect of poor handling of produce to various players throughout the value chain and how it can be prevented. Sustained public awareness campaigns are essential in order to improve the situation. Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus. - After harvest, the moisture content of produce must be dried to 12 to 14 percent for safe storage with minimum deterioration. - Reducing drought stress through irrigation and limiting insect dam - age by the application of good agricultural and pest control practic- es, including use of high quality seeds is essential. - Rapid drying limits aflatoxin proliferation for example, the piling of maize in stacks in the field extends drying time and therefore the potential for aflatoxins to be produced during the drying process. Wet-shelling of groundnuts prior to drying can also promote mould growth.\n\n### QUESTION\nCan eating grapefruit while on statins be safe?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Minerals of public health importance Iron is an essential component of blood and helps transfer oxygen to various body tissues. Dietary sources include red meat, fish, poultry (easily absorbed), legumes, leafy green vegetables (less easily absorbed, but absorption increases if eaten with animal source iron or vitamin C). Calcium is a key component of bones and teeth and is needed for a strong skeleton and important in blood clotting. The major source of calcium in the world is milk and milk products. Other sources include fish eaten with bones (silver fish\u2014mukene, haplochromis species\u2014nkeje) and dark green vegetables (plant sources are not well absorbed). Iodine is important for thyroid function and for mental development of children. The most important dietary source is iodized salt. Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains. Other minerals involved in various body functions are chromium, copper, fluoride, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, potas- sium, phosphorus, sodium and selenium. Mineral requirements Minerals that are required by the body in relatively large amounts such as calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, sodium and magnesium require deliberate efforts to be supplied them through increased food production, consumption and supplementation. Most trace mineral elements such as iodine copper, manganese, fluo - rine, cobalt, nickel, zinc, chromium and selenium are supplied by a wide variety of foods and the body is unlikely to be deficient in them when one consumes a balanced diet.\n\n### QUESTION\nBrown sugar contains way more minerals than white sugar, true?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 18) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers7Fat/lipid/oil requirements Fat provides high amounts of energy to the body; 1 g of fat produces over 9 kcals. Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day.

They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 86) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers75Vitamin/Mineral Source RDAaIts function in the body Vitamin H (Biotin)Oats, organ meats, yeast and eggs (cooked); also whole-wheat products, dairy products, fish and tomatoes.None; 30 - 200 \u00b5g suggestedMetabolizes proteins and carbohydrates; breaks down fatty acids.

Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 86) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers75Vitamin/Mineral Source RDAaIts function in the body Vitamin H (Biotin)Oats, organ meats, yeast and eggs (cooked); also whole-wheat products, dairy products, fish and tomatoes.None; 30 - 200 \u00b5g suggestedMetabolizes proteins and carbohydrates; breaks down fatty acids.
