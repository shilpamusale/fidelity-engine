Food safety is the protection of consumers from injury or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adul - terated or badly stored foods. Generally, food safety describes the handling, preparation and storage of food in ways that prevent food\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics.

In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children.

In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 39) Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored.\n\n### QUESTION\nI feel tired all the time.
