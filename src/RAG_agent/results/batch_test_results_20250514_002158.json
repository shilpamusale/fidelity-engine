They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal).

FOOD What is food? Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and energy and when taken or eaten nourishes the body. Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods. They provide energy to the body and are essential for phys-ical activity and basic functioning of the body. Foods like cereals, roots, tubers, starchy fruits and vegetables oils, milk, butter and ghee are good sources of energy.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 14) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers3 Figure 3: Examples of locally available vegetables and fruits which are rich sources of vitamins and mineralsc) Protective (\u201cGLOW\u201d foods) Foods rich in minerals and vitamins are known as protective or \u201cGLOW\u201d foods. They are essential for promoting body immunity and regulatory functions. Fruits and vegetables are the main sources of \u201cGLOW\u201d foods. Fortified foods, including iodized salt, are also good sources of \u201cGLOW\u201d foods.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 18) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers7Fat/lipid/oil requirements Fat provides high amounts of energy to the body; 1 g of fat produces over 9 kcals. Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n### QUESTION\nAccording to the handbook, one gram of carbohydrates provides how many kilocalories?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.

These foods help to maintain life and promote growth, repair worn out and damaged body tissues. \u201cGROW\u201d foods come from animal and plant sources.

SUMMARY - Exclusive breastfeeding is the safest and healthiest way to feed a baby for the first 6 months. - Babies need to be breastfed 8-12 times a day after every 2-3 hours or more as needed, in the first six months. - Mothers should continue to breast feed their babies up to the age of 2 years or more even after introducing complemen- tary feeding (weaning). Give food daily according to age, for example: - 6-8 month: feed 2-3 times a day - 9-11 month: feed 3-4 times a day - 12-24 month: feed 4-5meals a day\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 47) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers36 Picture 7: A pregnant woman and a breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the food groups, extra meals and take iron and folate daily. Nutrition for children 0 to 6 months Breastfeeding and complementary feeding behaviours are important predictors of infant and child nutrition, health and survival. Breast milk is the best food for babies and is all the baby needs up to six months of age. Children from birth to six months of age should be exclusively breastfed. If you introduce any food before six months you will poten-tially expose the baby to unsafe and poor quality meals. Exclusive breastfeeding refers to feeding a child on breast milk only for the first six months. Mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies as many times as the baby demands to be fed (at least 8 times a day, every 2-3 hours). This will help maintain milk production. Even when the child is ill, continue breast feeding.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 53) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers42Picture 11: A mother encourages and supervises her child\u2019s feeding following the six principles of complementary feeding practice from the age of 12 -24 months. KEY MESSAGES - From 6 months and beyond, children should be fed on other foods on top of the mother\u2019s breast milk. Milk should form the foundation of the child\u2019s diet between the ages of 0 to 2 years. - Use biofortified and/or fortified foods, when available; give vitamin/mineral supplements when animal products, fortified foods, or micronutrient (vitamin A, Fe & Zn) rich foods are not readily available.\n\n### QUESTION\nExclusive breastfeeding should be practiced for how many months?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils.

Reten- tion of physical and nutritional qualities of agricultural produce can be ensured by developing appropriate and improved postharvest handling, storage and cooking. This keeps consumers healthier and improves the marketability of farm produce. Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage - Harvest food at the right stage of maturity to ensure maximum nutrient availability, e.g., most fruits and vegetables have greater vitamin content if they are picked ripe from the plant, rather than being picked before they have fully ripened. - Over ripening of fruits will reduce the nutritional quality of fruits. - Avoid physical and mechanical damages during harvesting to ensure longer storage and safe food following the harvest. - Early planting prevents nuts from maturing during periods of low rainfall, which stresses a plant and encourages growth of the fungus on ripening crops. Cleaning - Drying of produce should be done on a clean and dry surface to avoid moisture and reduce the risk of contamination. As much as possible tarpaulins should be used. - It is recommended that drying is done on a raised platform, one (1) meter above the ground to reduce contamination from animals passing by. Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 71) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers60SUMMARY - Minimize storage losses attributable to harvesting, weevils and farm processing. - Harvest food at the right stage of maturity (avoid harvesting immature or over-mature produce in case of fruits don\u2019t har - vest under ripe or over ripe ones). - Avoid physical or mechanical damage during harvesting, transportation and handling of foods. - Avoid drying, shelling, threshing and winnowing food on bare ground (problems with contamination by microorganisms, sand and stones). - Sort and clean the food to remove diseased and poor quality produce and impurities. - Make sure that the produce is prepared under hygienic condi - tions all the time. - Recommended storage practices are very important for both perishables (fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, poultry and eggs) and non-perishables like cereals and legumes). - Maintain hygienic environment wherever food is produced and handled. - Practice appropriate food preservation in homes, e.g., drying, smoking or salting of meat and fish, preservation of fruits and vegetables by use of solar drying. - Discourage processing practices that contaminate the agricul- ture harvest. - Promote good storage practices that ensure safe and nutri - tious foods. - Not all food should go to the market. - Use income from non-food items to buy food.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers59- Clean and sort to remove broken kernels, foreign matter, and diseased and rotten foods (grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables); these attract mois - ture and pests leading to spoilage and/or fungal growth. - Ensure crops are properly dried immediately after harvesting; howev - er, drying will not reverse the effect of poison in the already contam- inated foods, but it may inhibit further growth of moulds and other microbes. Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced. For example, containers should be clean and dry. Household agroprocessing and value addition - Household or on-farm processing gives food security and nutrition benefits in addition to higher, potentially stable and regular incomes. - Simple/hand coffee processing tools will ensure that coffee husks remain and act as manure for crop enterprises. - Many foods that are transported to the urban centres and other markets in their very fresh forms result in considerable soil nutrient mining of the production areas and burdening of the waste disposal systems in the target markets. A case in point is the banana market in Uganda.

Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C.

Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils.

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body. Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits. A serving is a quantity of food suitable for or given to one person in one meal. Moderation means keeping servings reasonable. This involves self- control and addresses the aspect of too much food intake that leads to becoming overweight and obese.\n\n### QUESTION\nTrue or False: According to the handbook, children under two should receive only one meal per day.\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Reten- tion of physical and nutritional qualities of agricultural produce can be ensured by developing appropriate and improved postharvest handling, storage and cooking. This keeps consumers healthier and improves the marketability of farm produce. Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage - Harvest food at the right stage of maturity to ensure maximum nutrient availability, e.g., most fruits and vegetables have greater vitamin content if they are picked ripe from the plant, rather than being picked before they have fully ripened. - Over ripening of fruits will reduce the nutritional quality of fruits. - Avoid physical and mechanical damages during harvesting to ensure longer storage and safe food following the harvest. - Early planting prevents nuts from maturing during periods of low rainfall, which stresses a plant and encourages growth of the fungus on ripening crops. Cleaning - Drying of produce should be done on a clean and dry surface to avoid moisture and reduce the risk of contamination. As much as possible tarpaulins should be used. - It is recommended that drying is done on a raised platform, one (1) meter above the ground to reduce contamination from animals passing by. Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 71) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers60SUMMARY - Minimize storage losses attributable to harvesting, weevils and farm processing. - Harvest food at the right stage of maturity (avoid harvesting immature or over-mature produce in case of fruits don\u2019t har - vest under ripe or over ripe ones). - Avoid physical or mechanical damage during harvesting, transportation and handling of foods. - Avoid drying, shelling, threshing and winnowing food on bare ground (problems with contamination by microorganisms, sand and stones). - Sort and clean the food to remove diseased and poor quality produce and impurities. - Make sure that the produce is prepared under hygienic condi - tions all the time. - Recommended storage practices are very important for both perishables (fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, poultry and eggs) and non-perishables like cereals and legumes). - Maintain hygienic environment wherever food is produced and handled. - Practice appropriate food preservation in homes, e.g., drying, smoking or salting of meat and fish, preservation of fruits and vegetables by use of solar drying. - Discourage processing practices that contaminate the agricul- ture harvest. - Promote good storage practices that ensure safe and nutri - tious foods. - Not all food should go to the market. - Use income from non-food items to buy food.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 19) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers8KEY MESSAGE Promote production and consumption of fruits in all households as part of the broad iron deficiency anaemia prevention strategy.- Legumes such as beans, peas, and pigeon peas, among others. - Fruits such as mangoes, oranges, and pineapples, among others. 2) Micronutrients These are required by the body in small amounts and include: vitamins and minerals. Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron bioavailability from plant food sources.\n\n### QUESTION\nTrue or False: The handbook recommends harvesting fruits before they are fully ripe to maximize vitamin content.\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango).

WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access - Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. - For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. - The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. - The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality - Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. - Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. - Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 6) 39 CHAPTER FIVE: WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PRACTICES (WASH) .......... 43 Water access ........................................................................................................... 43 Water quality .......................................................................................................... 43 Hand washing .......................................................................................................... 44 Food hygiene ........................................................................................................... 44 Kitchen and housekeeping ...................................................................................... 46 Proper refuse disposal ............................................................................................ 47 Sanitation ................................................................................................................ 47 CHAPTER SIX: AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION ................................................................... 50 A) PLANNING FOR NUTRITION FRIENDLY AGRICULTURE: NEEDS IDENTIFICATION ...................................................................................................... 51 Keys considerations ................................................................................................ 51 B) NUTRITION SENSITIVE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION PRACTICES ...................... 53 C) NUTRITION CONSIDERATIONS IN HARVEST AND POSTHARVEST HANDLING ....57 Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage ................................................. 58 Cleaning .................................................................................................................. 58 Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest ................................................................................................. 58 Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods ....59 Distribution ............................................................................................................ 59 Household agroprocessing and value addition ...................................................... 59\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 26) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers15Water Maintains the fluid balance, cell turgidity, media for all biochemical reactions in the body, solvent for certain nutrients, used in removing excreta and keeps some parts of the body moist. Water is essential for life because it forms part of the body cells and fluids, such as blood and digestive juices.

All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat. - To enable body processes such as digestion. - To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and cool. - To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango).

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 15) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers4Body-building foods (proteins) \u201cGROW\u201d foods Animal Source Plant Source Meats: Beef, mulokony, lamb, pork, veal and game meat (e.g., rabbit, squirrel) Organ meats: Liver, giblets, offal, kidneyPoultry: Chicken, duck, goose, quails, pigeons, guinea fowl (domesticated and wild/ game) and turkey, eggs Fish: Silverfish (mukene), Nkejje, Nile perch, tilapia, mudfish, catfish, lungfishDairy products : Milk, cheese, sour milk, yoghurt Edible insects : Grasshoppers, termites, white- ants, crickets, bee larvaeBeans and peas (pulses) : chickpeas, pigeon peas, common beans, iron-rich beans, French beans, lentils, soybeans, white beans, peas Processed soy products: soy milk, soy flour, roasted/fried soy snacks Nuts and seeds: groundnuts, sesame seeds, cashew nuts Protective (health-giving) foods (vitamins) \u201cGLOW\u201d foods Vegetables Fruits Dark green leafy vegetables : Spinach, Dodo/ amarantha, sukumawiki, cow pea leaves, pumpkin leaves, cassava leaves, field pea leaves, immature corn, green pea leaves, yam leaves, sweet potato leaves, broccoli, lettuce, hibiscus leaves (Malakwang) Red and orange vegetables : Carrots, pumpkin, red peppers, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, red amaranths, red hibiscus Other vegetables : Beet roots, cabbage, eggplant, cucumbers, cauliflower, green beans, green peppers, mushrooms, okra, onions, beans sprouts, celery, nswiga (Solanum species)Bananas, pineapples, papaya (Paw paw), mangoes, guavas, oranges, jack fruit, tangerines, apples, custard fruit (Kitaferi), avocado, passion, orange, apple, melon, grapefruit Wild fruits : Tamarinds, berries, wild grapefruits\n\n### QUESTION\nIn one sentence, summarize a key recommendation from the handbook regarding protein (Prompt #17).\n\n### ANSWER\n",

A clean, organized home environment prevents us from diseases, keeps us comfortable and adds beauty and scenic appeal to our homes. When diseases occur, they directly and negatively affect the nutritional status of a person no matter how well fed he/she was.

Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals.

All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat. - To enable body processes such as digestion. - To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and cool. - To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well.

Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals.

A healthier and stronger household is more economically viable and resilient in the face of nutritional chal - lenges. WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access - Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. - For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. - The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. - The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality - Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. - Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. - Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 26) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers15Water Maintains the fluid balance, cell turgidity, media for all biochemical reactions in the body, solvent for certain nutrients, used in removing excreta and keeps some parts of the body moist. Water is essential for life because it forms part of the body cells and fluids, such as blood and digestive juices. Water requirements Drink water everyday especially in hot weather when much is lost through sweating to avoid dehydration. A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat. - To enable body processes such as digestion. - To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and cool. - To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water. Extra water is needed: - During illness when a raised temperature results in increased sweat - ing. If vomiting or diarrhoea has occurred, both of which can cause dehydration especially in babies. - In lactation when extra water is required for milk production. After intensive activity such as sport. NUTRITION Nutrition is the process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth. It broadly encompasses all actions necessary for obtaining, handling, preparing, serving, eating and utilization of food by the body.

Food hygiene Although statistics of food borne illnesses are scanty in Uganda, many people die as a result of diarrhoea disease cases. These are attributed to contaminated food or water, universal precautions apply to food handling like washing of raw fruits and vegetables. Good practices to improve food hygiene - Wash hands thoroughly before handling, preparing and eating food. - Wash the knives, chopping boards and all surfaces thoroughly with clean water before and after use. - Prepare and serve food when hot or warm.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 59) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers48 Picture 15: Examples of proper hygiene practices. Washing hands after visiting toilet. A locally fabricated hand washing facility (tippy tap) should be strategi- cally positioned near the latrine for hand wash water and soap/ash after visiting the latrine. A clean, organized home environment prevents us from diseases, keeps us comfortable and adds beauty and scenic appeal to our homes. When diseases occur, they directly and negatively affect the nutritional status of a person no matter how well fed he/she was. It is possible to attain good standards of hygiene and sanitation regardless of where we live and under what conditions we live in. By maintaining a clean environ - ment through practicing proper sanitation and hygiene, we prevent many infections and therefore save on resources (money, energy and time for treatment). Prevention is better than cure: - Ensure good personal hygiene by regularly bathing, washing your clothes, trimming hair and nails. - The home surrounding should be kept clean by: - Sweeping the compound every day. - Keeping grass low. - Draining all stagnant water around the house to keep away the mosquitoes. - Building animal houses.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 54) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers43CHAPTER FIVE WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PRACTICES (WASH) WASH practices help to prevent caregivers and other house hold members from contracting water-related diarrhoea diseases and associated food borne diseases.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well.

WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access - Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. - For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. - The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. - The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality - Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. - Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. - Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 6) 39 CHAPTER FIVE: WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PRACTICES (WASH) .......... 43 Water access ........................................................................................................... 43 Water quality .......................................................................................................... 43 Hand washing .......................................................................................................... 44 Food hygiene ........................................................................................................... 44 Kitchen and housekeeping ...................................................................................... 46 Proper refuse disposal ............................................................................................ 47 Sanitation ................................................................................................................ 47 CHAPTER SIX: AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION ................................................................... 50 A) PLANNING FOR NUTRITION FRIENDLY AGRICULTURE: NEEDS IDENTIFICATION ...................................................................................................... 51 Keys considerations ................................................................................................ 51 B) NUTRITION SENSITIVE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION PRACTICES ...................... 53 C) NUTRITION CONSIDERATIONS IN HARVEST AND POSTHARVEST HANDLING ....57 Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage ................................................. 58 Cleaning .................................................................................................................. 58 Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest ................................................................................................. 58 Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods ....59 Distribution ............................................................................................................ 59 Household agroprocessing and value addition ...................................................... 59\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 26) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers15Water Maintains the fluid balance, cell turgidity, media for all biochemical reactions in the body, solvent for certain nutrients, used in removing excreta and keeps some parts of the body moist. Water is essential for life because it forms part of the body cells and fluids, such as blood and digestive juices.

All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat. - To enable body processes such as digestion. - To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and cool. - To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water. Extra water is needed: - During illness when a raised temperature results in increased sweat - ing. If vomiting or diarrhoea has occurred, both of which can cause dehydration especially in babies. - In lactation when extra water is required for milk production.

A clean, organized home environment prevents us from diseases, keeps us comfortable and adds beauty and scenic appeal to our homes. When diseases occur, they directly and negatively affect the nutritional status of a person no matter how well fed he/she was. It is possible to attain good standards of hygiene and sanitation regardless of where we live and under what conditions we live in. By maintaining a clean environ - ment through practicing proper sanitation and hygiene, we prevent many infections and therefore save on resources (money, energy and time for treatment). Prevention is better than cure: - Ensure good personal hygiene by regularly bathing, washing your clothes, trimming hair and nails. - The home surrounding should be kept clean by: - Sweeping the compound every day. - Keeping grass low. - Draining all stagnant water around the house to keep away the mosquitoes. - Building animal houses.\n\n### QUESTION\nIn one sentence, summarize a key recommendation from the handbook regarding hand washing (Prompt #53).\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 15) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers4Body-building foods (proteins) \u201cGROW\u201d foods Animal Source Plant Source Meats: Beef, mulokony, lamb, pork, veal and game meat (e.g., rabbit, squirrel) Organ meats: Liver, giblets, offal, kidneyPoultry: Chicken, duck, goose, quails, pigeons, guinea fowl (domesticated and wild/ game) and turkey, eggs Fish: Silverfish (mukene), Nkejje, Nile perch, tilapia, mudfish, catfish, lungfishDairy products : Milk, cheese, sour milk, yoghurt Edible insects : Grasshoppers, termites, white- ants, crickets, bee larvaeBeans and peas (pulses) : chickpeas, pigeon peas, common beans, iron-rich beans, French beans, lentils, soybeans, white beans, peas Processed soy products: soy milk, soy flour, roasted/fried soy snacks Nuts and seeds: groundnuts, sesame seeds, cashew nuts Protective (health-giving) foods (vitamins) \u201cGLOW\u201d foods Vegetables Fruits Dark green leafy vegetables : Spinach, Dodo/ amarantha, sukumawiki, cow pea leaves, pumpkin leaves, cassava leaves, field pea leaves, immature corn, green pea leaves, yam leaves, sweet potato leaves, broccoli, lettuce, hibiscus leaves (Malakwang) Red and orange vegetables : Carrots, pumpkin, red peppers, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, red amaranths, red hibiscus Other vegetables : Beet roots, cabbage, eggplant, cucumbers, cauliflower, green beans, green peppers, mushrooms, okra, onions, beans sprouts, celery, nswiga (Solanum species)Bananas, pineapples, papaya (Paw paw), mangoes, guavas, oranges, jack fruit, tangerines, apples, custard fruit (Kitaferi), avocado, passion, orange, apple, melon, grapefruit Wild fruits : Tamarinds, berries, wild grapefruits\n\n### QUESTION\nIn one sentence, summarize a key recommendation from the handbook regarding protein (Prompt #59).\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Water quality - Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. - Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. - Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 6) 39 CHAPTER FIVE: WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PRACTICES (WASH) .......... 43 Water access ........................................................................................................... 43 Water quality .......................................................................................................... 43 Hand washing .......................................................................................................... 44 Food hygiene ........................................................................................................... 44 Kitchen and housekeeping ...................................................................................... 46 Proper refuse disposal ............................................................................................ 47 Sanitation ................................................................................................................ 47 CHAPTER SIX: AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION ................................................................... 50 A) PLANNING FOR NUTRITION FRIENDLY AGRICULTURE: NEEDS IDENTIFICATION ...................................................................................................... 51 Keys considerations ................................................................................................ 51 B) NUTRITION SENSITIVE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION PRACTICES ...................... 53 C) NUTRITION CONSIDERATIONS IN HARVEST AND POSTHARVEST HANDLING ....57 Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage ................................................. 58 Cleaning .................................................................................................................. 58 Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest ................................................................................................. 58 Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods ....59 Distribution ............................................................................................................ 59 Household agroprocessing and value addition ...................................................... 59\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 26) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers15Water Maintains the fluid balance, cell turgidity, media for all biochemical reactions in the body, solvent for certain nutrients, used in removing excreta and keeps some parts of the body moist. Water is essential for life because it forms part of the body cells and fluids, such as blood and digestive juices. Water requirements Drink water everyday especially in hot weather when much is lost through sweating to avoid dehydration. A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat. - To enable body processes such as digestion. - To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and cool. - To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water. Extra water is needed: - During illness when a raised temperature results in increased sweat - ing. If vomiting or diarrhoea has occurred, both of which can cause dehydration especially in babies. - In lactation when extra water is required for milk production. After intensive activity such as sport. NUTRITION Nutrition is the process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth. It broadly encompasses all actions necessary for obtaining, handling, preparing, serving, eating and utilization of food by the body. When individuals or communities do not feed appropriately they face a possibility of becoming malnourished and can face serious\n\n### QUESTION\nIn one sentence, summarize a key recommendation from the handbook regarding water access (Prompt #62).\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils.

However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.

Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well.

This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango).

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals.

Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C.

Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils.

However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.

Hand washing If done properly and at critical times, washing hands with soap or an abrasive substance such as is effective in preventing diarrhoea. Food hygiene Although statistics of food borne illnesses are scanty in Uganda, many people die as a result of diarrhoea disease cases. These are attributed to contaminated food or water, universal precautions apply to food handling like washing of raw fruits and vegetables. Good practices to improve food hygiene - Wash hands thoroughly before handling, preparing and eating food. - Wash the knives, chopping boards and all surfaces thoroughly with clean water before and after use. - Prepare and serve food when hot or warm.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 59) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers48 Picture 15: Examples of proper hygiene practices. Washing hands after visiting toilet. A locally fabricated hand washing facility (tippy tap) should be strategi- cally positioned near the latrine for hand wash water and soap/ash after visiting the latrine. A clean, organized home environment prevents us from diseases, keeps us comfortable and adds beauty and scenic appeal to our homes. When diseases occur, they directly and negatively affect the nutritional status of a person no matter how well fed he/she was. It is possible to attain good standards of hygiene and sanitation regardless of where we live and under what conditions we live in. By maintaining a clean environ - ment through practicing proper sanitation and hygiene, we prevent many infections and therefore save on resources (money, energy and time for treatment). Prevention is better than cure: - Ensure good personal hygiene by regularly bathing, washing your clothes, trimming hair and nails. - The home surrounding should be kept clean by: - Sweeping the compound every day. - Keeping grass low. - Draining all stagnant water around the house to keep away the mosquitoes. - Building animal houses.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 54) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers43CHAPTER FIVE WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PRACTICES (WASH) WASH practices help to prevent caregivers and other house hold members from contracting water-related diarrhoea diseases and associated food borne diseases. A healthier and stronger household is more economically viable and resilient in the face of nutritional chal - lenges. WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access - Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. - For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. - The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. - The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality - Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. - Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. - Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.\n\n### QUESTION\nIn one sentence, summarize a key recommendation from the handbook regarding hand washing (Prompt #84).\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils.

However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 15) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers4Body-building foods (proteins) \u201cGROW\u201d foods Animal Source Plant Source Meats: Beef, mulokony, lamb, pork, veal and game meat (e.g., rabbit, squirrel) Organ meats: Liver, giblets, offal, kidneyPoultry: Chicken, duck, goose, quails, pigeons, guinea fowl (domesticated and wild/ game) and turkey, eggs Fish: Silverfish (mukene), Nkejje, Nile perch, tilapia, mudfish, catfish, lungfishDairy products : Milk, cheese, sour milk, yoghurt Edible insects : Grasshoppers, termites, white- ants, crickets, bee larvaeBeans and peas (pulses) : chickpeas, pigeon peas, common beans, iron-rich beans, French beans, lentils, soybeans, white beans, peas Processed soy products: soy milk, soy flour, roasted/fried soy snacks Nuts and seeds: groundnuts, sesame seeds, cashew nuts Protective (health-giving) foods (vitamins) \u201cGLOW\u201d foods Vegetables Fruits Dark green leafy vegetables : Spinach, Dodo/ amarantha, sukumawiki, cow pea leaves, pumpkin leaves, cassava leaves, field pea leaves, immature corn, green pea leaves, yam leaves, sweet potato leaves, broccoli, lettuce, hibiscus leaves (Malakwang) Red and orange vegetables : Carrots, pumpkin, red peppers, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, red amaranths, red hibiscus Other vegetables : Beet roots, cabbage, eggplant, cucumbers, cauliflower, green beans, green peppers, mushrooms, okra, onions, beans sprouts, celery, nswiga (Solanum species)Bananas, pineapples, papaya (Paw paw), mangoes, guavas, oranges, jack fruit, tangerines, apples, custard fruit (Kitaferi), avocado, passion, orange, apple, melon, grapefruit Wild fruits : Tamarinds, berries, wild grapefruits\n\n### QUESTION\nIn one sentence, summarize a key recommendation from the handbook regarding protein (Prompt #89).\n\n### ANSWER\n",

A healthier and stronger household is more economically viable and resilient in the face of nutritional chal - lenges. WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access - Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. - For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. - The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. - The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality - Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. - Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. - Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 6) 39 CHAPTER FIVE: WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PRACTICES (WASH) .......... 43 Water access ........................................................................................................... 43 Water quality .......................................................................................................... 43 Hand washing .......................................................................................................... 44 Food hygiene ........................................................................................................... 44 Kitchen and housekeeping ...................................................................................... 46 Proper refuse disposal ............................................................................................ 47 Sanitation ................................................................................................................ 47 CHAPTER SIX: AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION ................................................................... 50 A) PLANNING FOR NUTRITION FRIENDLY AGRICULTURE: NEEDS IDENTIFICATION ...................................................................................................... 51 Keys considerations ................................................................................................ 51 B) NUTRITION SENSITIVE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION PRACTICES ...................... 53 C) NUTRITION CONSIDERATIONS IN HARVEST AND POSTHARVEST HANDLING ....57 Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage ................................................. 58 Cleaning .................................................................................................................. 58 Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest ................................................................................................. 58 Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods ....59 Distribution ............................................................................................................ 59 Household agroprocessing and value addition ...................................................... 59\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 26) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers15Water Maintains the fluid balance, cell turgidity, media for all biochemical reactions in the body, solvent for certain nutrients, used in removing excreta and keeps some parts of the body moist. Water is essential for life because it forms part of the body cells and fluids, such as blood and digestive juices. Water requirements Drink water everyday especially in hot weather when much is lost through sweating to avoid dehydration. A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat. - To enable body processes such as digestion. - To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and cool. - To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water. Extra water is needed: - During illness when a raised temperature results in increased sweat - ing. If vomiting or diarrhoea has occurred, both of which can cause dehydration especially in babies. - In lactation when extra water is required for milk production. After intensive activity such as sport. NUTRITION Nutrition is the process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well.

A healthier and stronger household is more economically viable and resilient in the face of nutritional chal - lenges. WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access - Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. - For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. - The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. - The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality - Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. - Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. - Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.\n\n### QUESTION\nIn one sentence, summarize a key recommendation from the handbook regarding hand washing (Prompt #102).\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well.

A clean, organized home environment prevents us from diseases, keeps us comfortable and adds beauty and scenic appeal to our homes. When diseases occur, they directly and negatively affect the nutritional status of a person no matter how well fed he/she was. It is possible to attain good standards of hygiene and sanitation regardless of where we live and under what conditions we live in. By maintaining a clean environ - ment through practicing proper sanitation and hygiene, we prevent many infections and therefore save on resources (money, energy and time for treatment). Prevention is better than cure: - Ensure good personal hygiene by regularly bathing, washing your clothes, trimming hair and nails. - The home surrounding should be kept clean by: - Sweeping the compound every day. - Keeping grass low. - Draining all stagnant water around the house to keep away the mosquitoes. - Building animal houses.\n\n### QUESTION\nIn one sentence, summarize a key recommendation from the handbook regarding hand washing (Prompt #107).\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals.

Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature.

However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.

A clean, organized home environment prevents us from diseases, keeps us comfortable and adds beauty and scenic appeal to our homes. When diseases occur, they directly and negatively affect the nutritional status of a person no matter how well fed he/she was. It is possible to attain good standards of hygiene and sanitation regardless of where we live and under what conditions we live in. By maintaining a clean environ - ment through practicing proper sanitation and hygiene, we prevent many infections and therefore save on resources (money, energy and time for treatment). Prevention is better than cure: - Ensure good personal hygiene by regularly bathing, washing your clothes, trimming hair and nails. - The home surrounding should be kept clean by: - Sweeping the compound every day. - Keeping grass low. - Draining all stagnant water around the house to keep away the mosquitoes. - Building animal houses.\n\n### QUESTION\nIn one sentence, summarize a key recommendation from the handbook regarding hand washing (Prompt #121).\n\n### ANSWER\n",

By maintaining a clean environ - ment through practicing proper sanitation and hygiene, we prevent many infections and therefore save on resources (money, energy and time for treatment). Prevention is better than cure: - Ensure good personal hygiene by regularly bathing, washing your clothes, trimming hair and nails. - The home surrounding should be kept clean by: - Sweeping the compound every day. - Keeping grass low. - Draining all stagnant water around the house to keep away the mosquitoes. - Building animal houses.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 54) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers43CHAPTER FIVE WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PRACTICES (WASH) WASH practices help to prevent caregivers and other house hold members from contracting water-related diarrhoea diseases and associated food borne diseases.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well.

A healthier and stronger household is more economically viable and resilient in the face of nutritional chal - lenges. WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access - Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. - For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. - The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. - The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality - Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. - Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. - Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 6) 39 CHAPTER FIVE: WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PRACTICES (WASH) .......... 43 Water access ........................................................................................................... 43 Water quality .......................................................................................................... 43 Hand washing .......................................................................................................... 44 Food hygiene ........................................................................................................... 44 Kitchen and housekeeping ...................................................................................... 46 Proper refuse disposal ............................................................................................ 47 Sanitation ................................................................................................................ 47 CHAPTER SIX: AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION ................................................................... 50 A) PLANNING FOR NUTRITION FRIENDLY AGRICULTURE: NEEDS IDENTIFICATION ...................................................................................................... 51 Keys considerations ................................................................................................ 51 B) NUTRITION SENSITIVE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION PRACTICES ...................... 53 C) NUTRITION CONSIDERATIONS IN HARVEST AND POSTHARVEST HANDLING ....57 Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage ................................................. 58 Cleaning .................................................................................................................. 58 Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest ................................................................................................. 58 Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods ....59 Distribution ............................................................................................................ 59 Household agroprocessing and value addition ...................................................... 59\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 26) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers15Water Maintains the fluid balance, cell turgidity, media for all biochemical reactions in the body, solvent for certain nutrients, used in removing excreta and keeps some parts of the body moist. Water is essential for life because it forms part of the body cells and fluids, such as blood and digestive juices. Water requirements Drink water everyday especially in hot weather when much is lost through sweating to avoid dehydration. A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat. - To enable body processes such as digestion. - To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and cool. - To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water. Extra water is needed: - During illness when a raised temperature results in increased sweat - ing. If vomiting or diarrhoea has occurred, both of which can cause dehydration especially in babies. - In lactation when extra water is required for milk production. After intensive activity such as sport. NUTRITION Nutrition is the process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth.

This includes a number of routine activities that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards. Food safety is a public health priority because millions of people world - wide fall ill every year and many die as a result of eating unsafe food. Importance of food safety in Uganda - As the country develops, an increasing percentage of the population is eating food prepared from outside the home or at least processed away from home. The majority of the market participants in the food industry are not aware of food safety issues and this is increas- ingly exposing the population to unsafe food consumption. - Current practices of food production, postharvest handling, process- ing, packaging, transportation, retailing and food preparation in the homes, street food vending and some restaurants may lead to food becoming unsafe for consumption. - Food safety related illnesses and problems such as cancer preva-lence are now a common occurrence in Uganda. - Much of this burden of illness results from basic sanitation failures that occur in food production, processing, storage, transportation, retailing and handling in the home or streets, restaurants and ho - tels. Potential hazards associated with food in Uganda Microbial pathogens for example: salmonella, campylobacter and esch- erichia coliare are associated with Diarrhoea diseases. Zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans through food products, for example tuberculosis and brucellosis. Parasitic or ganisms , in particular cysticercosis, tape worms other intes- tinal worms from poorly cooked pork or beef. Naturally occurring toxicants for example, mycotoxins like aflatoxin.Agrochemical and veterinary drug residues that are used in crop agricul- tural production including pesticides or animal production for example, antibiotics like tetracycline.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 62) Planning should focus on adoption of labour saving technologies to free time for provision of child care.

Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil.

Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal).

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal).

Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nThe handbook declares that one gram of fat provides 2 kilocalories\u2014 is this correct?
