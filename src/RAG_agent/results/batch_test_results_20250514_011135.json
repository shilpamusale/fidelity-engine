They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 12) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers1CHAPTER ONE BASICS OF FOOD AND NUTRITION Picture 1: Some of the locally available energy-giving foodsThis chapter provides simple scientific information on food compo - nents and nutrition science. FOOD What is food? Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and energy and when taken or eaten nourishes the body. Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods. They provide energy to the body and are essential for phys-ical activity and basic functioning of the body. Foods like cereals, roots, tubers, starchy fruits and vegetables oils, milk, butter and ghee are good sources of energy.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 14) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers3 Figure 3: Examples of locally available vegetables and fruits which are rich sources of vitamins and mineralsc) Protective (\u201cGLOW\u201d foods) Foods rich in minerals and vitamins are known as protective or \u201cGLOW\u201d foods. They are essential for promoting body immunity and regulatory functions. Fruits and vegetables are the main sources of \u201cGLOW\u201d foods. Fortified foods, including iodized salt, are also good sources of \u201cGLOW\u201d foods.

Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron bioavailability from plant food sources.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 23) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers12Minerals Minerals are required for the normal functioning of body processes, including growth, development, water balance and neurological processes. Minerals of public health importance Iron is an essential component of blood and helps transfer oxygen to various body tissues. Dietary sources include red meat, fish, poultry (easily absorbed), legumes, leafy green vegetables (less easily absorbed, but absorption increases if eaten with animal source iron or vitamin C). Calcium is a key component of bones and teeth and is needed for a strong skeleton and important in blood clotting. The major source of calcium in the world is milk and milk products. Other sources include fish eaten with bones (silver fish\u2014mukene, haplochromis species\u2014nkeje) and dark green vegetables (plant sources are not well absorbed). Iodine is important for thyroid function and for mental development of children. The most important dietary source is iodized salt. Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains. Other minerals involved in various body functions are chromium, copper, fluoride, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, potas- sium, phosphorus, sodium and selenium. Mineral requirements Minerals that are required by the body in relatively large amounts such as calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, sodium and magnesium require deliberate efforts to be supplied them through increased food production, consumption and supplementation. Most trace mineral elements such as iodine copper, manganese, fluo - rine, cobalt, nickel, zinc, chromium and selenium are supplied by a wide variety of foods and the body is unlikely to be deficient in them when one consumes a balanced diet.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 86) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers75Vitamin/Mineral Source RDAaIts function in the body Vitamin H (Biotin)Oats, organ meats, yeast and eggs (cooked); also whole-wheat products, dairy products, fish and tomatoes.None; 30 - 200 \u00b5g suggestedMetabolizes proteins and carbohydrates; breaks down fatty acids.

Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 18) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers7Fat/lipid/oil requirements Fat provides high amounts of energy to the body; 1 g of fat produces over 9 kcals. Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 7) 86 Annex 5.

Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.

Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron bioavailability from plant food sources.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 84) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers73Vitamin/Mineral Source RDAaIts function in the body Vitamin A (Retinolor Beta-carotene)Liver, egg yolk, dairy products, margarine.

Minerals of public health importance Iron is an essential component of blood and helps transfer oxygen to various body tissues. Dietary sources include red meat, fish, poultry (easily absorbed), legumes, leafy green vegetables (less easily absorbed, but absorption increases if eaten with animal source iron or vitamin C). Calcium is a key component of bones and teeth and is needed for a strong skeleton and important in blood clotting. The major source of calcium in the world is milk and milk products. Other sources include fish eaten with bones (silver fish\u2014mukene, haplochromis species\u2014nkeje) and dark green vegetables (plant sources are not well absorbed). Iodine is important for thyroid function and for mental development of children. The most important dietary source is iodized salt. Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains. Other minerals involved in various body functions are chromium, copper, fluoride, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, potas- sium, phosphorus, sodium and selenium. Mineral requirements Minerals that are required by the body in relatively large amounts such as calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, sodium and magnesium require deliberate efforts to be supplied them through increased food production, consumption and supplementation. Most trace mineral elements such as iodine copper, manganese, fluo - rine, cobalt, nickel, zinc, chromium and selenium are supplied by a wide variety of foods and the body is unlikely to be deficient in them when one consumes a balanced diet.\n\n### QUESTION\nList two examples of dark green leafy vegetables classified as GLOW foods in the handbook.\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 43) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers32 Picture 6: Examples of a variety of the locally available foods from the three main food groupsAn example of a mixed meal guide to achieve a balanced diet SUMMARY - Eat a lot of whole cereals and beans or legumes generally, if you can\u2019t afford animal protein and as much as possible take some milk in your meals. - Eat a variety of food types from different main three groups (energy giving, body building and protective foods) at a very meal. - For lunch and supper take a fruit and a serving of vegetables (100g or one handful of fresh vegetables). - Avoid eating too much salt, too much sugar, drinking too much alcohol and too much fatty red meat. - These feeding habits predispose people to diseases such as: high blood pressure, diabetes, overweight, obesity.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 65) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers544.

Intercropping or crop rotation is one of the farming systems that has soil health and nutrition benefits. Legumes are ideal for intercropping with other crops because they fix nitrogen in the soil resulting in high yields from improved soil health. Others include: - Agroforestry - Integrated farming systems (animal & plants) - Soil and water conservation practices - Organic/sustainable agriculture 3) Promote use of labour saving technologies. The use of labour saving technologies such as rain water harvesting; use of animal trac- tion (ploughing, carrying manure/ mulch, water, firewood and harvest), improved cooking stoves, planting of woodlots, minimum tillage (use of pesticides and herbicides) will reduce women workload and allow ample time for child care. 4) Control diseases, agricultural chemical and veterinary drug resi - dues associa ted with f ood pr oduction s ystems. These diseases can be broadly classified as follows: - Water-associated/waterborne diseases caused by use of contami- nated water from faecal material (cholera) and chemical intoxica- tion. In addition, diseases caused by vectors living in stagnant water and or storage systems (Malaria, schictosomiasis/bilharzia worms, River blindness). - Zoonoses diseases are diseases transmitted from animals to human being. Examples include: tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, rabies, SARS/avian influenza and ebola. Control of these diseases is important because they can be trans - mitted to human beings, imposing on them poor health and atten- dant undesirable nutrition related effects including the disease burden.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich animal protein does the handbook describe as \u2018best among animal proteins\u2019?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

SUMMARY - Exclusive breastfeeding is the safest and healthiest way to feed a baby for the first 6 months. - Babies need to be breastfed 8-12 times a day after every 2-3 hours or more as needed, in the first six months. - Mothers should continue to breast feed their babies up to the age of 2 years or more even after introducing complemen- tary feeding (weaning). Give food daily according to age, for example: - 6-8 month: feed 2-3 times a day - 9-11 month: feed 3-4 times a day - 12-24 month: feed 4-5meals a day\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 47) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers36 Picture 7: A pregnant woman and a breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the food groups, extra meals and take iron and folate daily. Nutrition for children 0 to 6 months Breastfeeding and complementary feeding behaviours are important predictors of infant and child nutrition, health and survival. Breast milk is the best food for babies and is all the baby needs up to six months of age. Children from birth to six months of age should be exclusively breastfed. If you introduce any food before six months you will poten-tially expose the baby to unsafe and poor quality meals. Exclusive breastfeeding refers to feeding a child on breast milk only for the first six months. Mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies as many times as the baby demands to be fed (at least 8 times a day, every 2-3 hours). This will help maintain milk production. Even when the child is ill, continue breast feeding.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 53) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers42Picture 11: A mother encourages and supervises her child\u2019s feeding following the six principles of complementary feeding practice from the age of 12 -24 months. KEY MESSAGES - From 6 months and beyond, children should be fed on other foods on top of the mother\u2019s breast milk. Milk should form the foundation of the child\u2019s diet between the ages of 0 to 2 years. - Use biofortified and/or fortified foods, when available; give vitamin/mineral supplements when animal products, fortified foods, or micronutrient (vitamin A, Fe & Zn) rich foods are not readily available.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 50) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers39Weaning/complementary feeding practices Weaning is the gradual introduction of food into the diet of the child. Alongside breast milk at the age of six months, beyond 6 months, breast milk alone is not enough to meet the child\u2019s increased nutritional needs for proper growth and development. During weaning there are six princi - ples to follow: meal frequency, amount, thickness, variety, active feeding and hygiene. This is commonly referred to as the FATVAH. 1. Frequency of meals refers to the number of meals eaten in a day. In order to meet the child\u2019s body\u2019s needs, for growth, development, and activity, we must feed them frequent meals, meaning 3 meals and 2 snacks each day. 2. Amount of foods refers to how much food is eaten at each meal. It is important to eat foods in the appropriate amounts, again to ensure that we are not getting too little or too much food. For example, the youngest child needs less while the eldest child needs more amount of food for each meal as shown on table 3. 3. Thickness of foods/consistency (not too thick as to have difficulty chewing or swallowing, not too watery). The thickness of foods/ consis - tency is an important factor to eating well, because if food is too thick, it might make it difficult to chew and swallow. However, if food is too watery, the energy value of the food is reduced. 4. V ariety of diff erent f oods from each food group. In session 2 we learned about the food groups and their importance. We now know that each food serves the body differently (\u201cGO\u201d, \u201cGLOW\u201d, \u201cGROW\u201d), therefore it is important to have a variety of foods from each food group in order to eat well. Use fortified foods, when available; give vitamin/mineral supplements when animal products, fortified foods, or micronu - trient (vitamin A, Fe & Zn) rich foods are not readily available.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 49) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers38Advantages of breastfeeding - Breast milk is the best nutritionally balanced food for the baby. It contains all the nutrients required by the baby in the correct pro- portions. The nutrients are in forms that are easy for the baby to digest and absorb. - Breast milk contains substances that help the baby to fight infec - tions and stay healthy. Most of these substances are found in the yellowish milk (colostrum) that is produced in the first few days afterbirth. - Breast milk is released at a correct temperature suitable for baby. - Breast milk is safe, there is no danger of contamination during preparation. - Breast feeding is relatively cheap compared to other alternatives. - Breast feeding promotes bonding between mother and baby. - Delays return of menstruation and delays the next pregnancy there-by spacing the children. - Helps the mother to shrink the uterus back to its normal size. - Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months helps a child\u2019s mental (brain) development. SUMMARY - Exclusive breastfeeding is the safest and healthiest way to feed a baby for the first 6 months. - Babies need to be breastfed 8-12 times a day after every 2-3 hours or more as needed, in the first six months. - Mothers should continue to breast feed their babies up to the age of 2 years or more even after introducing complemen- tary feeding (weaning). Give food daily according to age, for example: - 6-8 month: feed 2-3 times a day - 9-11 month: feed 3-4 times a day - 12-24 month: feed 4-5meals a day\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 48) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers37Picture 8: A mother breastfeeding her baby and hand expressing her milk to leave for the baby when she is away.KEY MESSAGES - A baby from birth to 6 months of age should be fed only on breast milk and no other milk or foods. - A breastfeeding mother should take a balanced diet and in ad - dition to 3 meals daily should eat 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 46) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers35Nutrition for breastfeeding mothers Nutritional requirements during breastfeeding are higher than during pregnancy because the mother has to produce enough milk to sustain a baby (bigger than the foetus) for the first six months and beyond. Breast - feeding women need to eat a wide variety of foods. Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total). Breastfeeding mothers should also take a lot of fluids to cater for the high amounts of water used to make breast milk. They should avoid self-medication, smoking and alcohol to prevent intoxicating the baby. Breastfeeding mothers should avoid stress and have enough rest.KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a pregnant mother has a balanced diet, with a vari- ety of foods from the food groups, and has one additional meal in addition to the 3 meals she receives daily. The fourth meal caters to her physiological needs. - Pregnant women should take iron and folate tablets daily in addition to foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin A. KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a breastfeeding mother take a balanced diet and in addition to 3 meals daily receives 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby. - A pregnant woman and breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the main food groups daily.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age. The young child gradually becomes accustomed to eating ordinary foods. Breastfeeding should continue until the child is 2 years old or even beyond because breast milk is an important source of nutrients and protective factors.

It is therefore less likely to give a child diarrhoea than ordinary porridge. - It is thinner and easier for a baby to eat and digest than plain por - ridge. - The absorption of non-haem iron, zinc and some other minerals is increased. Suggestions for stopping the child from breast feeding Complete withdrawal of a child from breast milk should be a slow and gradual process. Encourage the mother to systematically stop breast feeding by following the steps below: - Make sure that the child continues to feed well at least four to five times a day.\n\n### QUESTION\nExclusive breastfeeding should be practiced for how many months?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 16) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils.

Uganda Nutrition Advocacy Messages (PROFILES) The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition-related illnesses or deaths in their families. The country losses about US$34 million worth of productivity because of iron defi-ciency anaemia among adults. Women of reproductive age with anaemia accounted for 75 percent, or US$25 million, of that loss. The total loss estimated at about 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product/GDP . Stunting in early childhood affects productivity in adulthood. For every 1 percent that the height of a child under 2 years of age is below the norm, the child\u2019s productivity from manual labour as an adult declines by 1.4 percent. Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting. These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009). Vitamin A deficiency, which affects mainly women and children in Uganda, increases the risk of blindness and susceptibility to diseases, mainly diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in children. Children with vitamin A deficiency are 1.4 times more likely to die of these and other childhood illnesses than ones that are not deficient. Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili - ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent. Because of IDD, in the year 2009 alone, 2,100 children were born as cretins in Uganda and likely will require 100 percent care in their entire lives, 59,000 children were born with mild or moderate mental disabil - ities and Uganda lost US$8.6 million in productivity (Uganda Profiles 2012).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 5) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workersv Table of Contents CHAPTER ONE: BASICS OF FOOD AND NUTRITION ............................................ 1 FOOD .......................................................................................................................... 1 What is food? ............................................................................................................. 1 Classification of foods according to their functions .................................................. 1 a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) .................................................................. 1 b) Body-building foods (\u201cGROW\u201d foods) ............................................................ 2 c) Protective (\u201cGLOW\u201d foods) ............................................................................. 3 Nutrients in food ........................................................................................................ 5 Major nutrients in human nutrition .......................................................................... 5 1) Macronutrients .............................................................................................. 5 2) Micronutrients ............................................................................................... 8 Vitamins ..................................................................................................................... 8 Vitamins requirements .............................................................................................. 9 Minerals .................................................................................................................. 12 Water ...................................................................................................................... 15 Water requirements ............................................................................................... 15 NUTRITION .............................................................................................................. 15 What is nutrition? ...................................................................................................\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 6) 51 B) NUTRITION SENSITIVE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION PRACTICES ...................... 53 C) NUTRITION CONSIDERATIONS IN HARVEST AND POSTHARVEST HANDLING ....57 Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage ................................................. 58 Cleaning .................................................................................................................. 58 Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest ................................................................................................. 58 Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods ....59 Distribution ............................................................................................................ 59 Household agroprocessing and value addition ...................................................... 59\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 44) One of the leading causes of maternal death at childbirth is insufficient blood.

Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 26) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers15Water Maintains the fluid balance, cell turgidity, media for all biochemical reactions in the body, solvent for certain nutrients, used in removing excreta and keeps some parts of the body moist. Water is essential for life because it forms part of the body cells and fluids, such as blood and digestive juices. Water requirements Drink water everyday especially in hot weather when much is lost through sweating to avoid dehydration. A minimum of 2 -3 Litres per day is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need. The body requires water for many functions: - To transport nutrients around the body. - To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat. - To enable body processes such as digestion. - To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and cool. - To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water. Extra water is needed: - During illness when a raised temperature results in increased sweat - ing. If vomiting or diarrhoea has occurred, both of which can cause dehydration especially in babies. - In lactation when extra water is required for milk production. After intensive activity such as sport. NUTRITION Nutrition is the process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth. It broadly encompasses all actions necessary for obtaining, handling, preparing, serving, eating and utilization of food by the body. When individuals or communities do not feed appropriately they face a possibility of becoming malnourished and can face serious\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 51) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers406. Food Hygiene. Proper hygiene practices will prevent disease occur - rences and hence ensure good child growth and development: washing hands before eating and handling foods, clean utensils and clean water. This is a very important factor needed for eating well. Good hygiene reduces the risk of diseases. Table 4.

Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 7) 86 Annex 5.

Alongside breast milk at the age of six months, beyond 6 months, breast milk alone is not enough to meet the child\u2019s increased nutritional needs for proper growth and development. During weaning there are six princi - ples to follow: meal frequency, amount, thickness, variety, active feeding and hygiene. This is commonly referred to as the FATVAH. 1. Frequency of meals refers to the number of meals eaten in a day. In order to meet the child\u2019s body\u2019s needs, for growth, development, and activity, we must feed them frequent meals, meaning 3 meals and 2 snacks each day. 2. Amount of foods refers to how much food is eaten at each meal. It is important to eat foods in the appropriate amounts, again to ensure that we are not getting too little or too much food. For example, the youngest child needs less while the eldest child needs more amount of food for each meal as shown on table 3. 3. Thickness of foods/consistency (not too thick as to have difficulty chewing or swallowing, not too watery). The thickness of foods/ consis - tency is an important factor to eating well, because if food is too thick, it might make it difficult to chew and swallow. However, if food is too watery, the energy value of the food is reduced. 4. V ariety of diff erent f oods from each food group. In session 2 we learned about the food groups and their importance. We now know that each food serves the body differently (\u201cGO\u201d, \u201cGLOW\u201d, \u201cGROW\u201d), therefore it is important to have a variety of foods from each food group in order to eat well. Use fortified foods, when available; give vitamin/mineral supplements when animal products, fortified foods, or micronu - trient (vitamin A, Fe & Zn) rich foods are not readily available.\n\n### QUESTION\nHow much cholesterol per day does the handbook advise not to exceed?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Reten- tion of physical and nutritional qualities of agricultural produce can be ensured by developing appropriate and improved postharvest handling, storage and cooking. This keeps consumers healthier and improves the marketability of farm produce. Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage - Harvest food at the right stage of maturity to ensure maximum nutrient availability, e.g., most fruits and vegetables have greater vitamin content if they are picked ripe from the plant, rather than being picked before they have fully ripened. - Over ripening of fruits will reduce the nutritional quality of fruits. - Avoid physical and mechanical damages during harvesting to ensure longer storage and safe food following the harvest. - Early planting prevents nuts from maturing during periods of low rainfall, which stresses a plant and encourages growth of the fungus on ripening crops. Cleaning - Drying of produce should be done on a clean and dry surface to avoid moisture and reduce the risk of contamination. As much as possible tarpaulins should be used. - It is recommended that drying is done on a raised platform, one (1) meter above the ground to reduce contamination from animals passing by. Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 71) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers60SUMMARY - Minimize storage losses attributable to harvesting, weevils and farm processing. - Harvest food at the right stage of maturity (avoid harvesting immature or over-mature produce in case of fruits don\u2019t har - vest under ripe or over ripe ones). - Avoid physical or mechanical damage during harvesting, transportation and handling of foods. - Avoid drying, shelling, threshing and winnowing food on bare ground (problems with contamination by microorganisms, sand and stones). - Sort and clean the food to remove diseased and poor quality produce and impurities. - Make sure that the produce is prepared under hygienic condi - tions all the time. - Recommended storage practices are very important for both perishables (fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, poultry and eggs) and non-perishables like cereals and legumes). - Maintain hygienic environment wherever food is produced and handled. - Practice appropriate food preservation in homes, e.g., drying, smoking or salting of meat and fish, preservation of fruits and vegetables by use of solar drying. - Discourage processing practices that contaminate the agricul- ture harvest. - Promote good storage practices that ensure safe and nutri - tious foods. - Not all food should go to the market. - Use income from non-food items to buy food.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers59- Clean and sort to remove broken kernels, foreign matter, and diseased and rotten foods (grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables); these attract mois - ture and pests leading to spoilage and/or fungal growth. - Ensure crops are properly dried immediately after harvesting; howev - er, drying will not reverse the effect of poison in the already contam- inated foods, but it may inhibit further growth of moulds and other microbes. Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced. For example, containers should be clean and dry. Household agroprocessing and value addition - Household or on-farm processing gives food security and nutrition benefits in addition to higher, potentially stable and regular incomes. - Simple/hand coffee processing tools will ensure that coffee husks remain and act as manure for crop enterprises. - Many foods that are transported to the urban centres and other markets in their very fresh forms result in considerable soil nutrient mining of the production areas and burdening of the waste disposal systems in the target markets. A case in point is the banana market in Uganda. KEY MESSAGE Promote household/cottage level agriculture value addition for better incomes and as part of sustainable agricultural production systems for improving food security and nutrition.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 33) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers22- Poor food preparation, storage, preservation and processing practices at household levels. - Beliefs and practices that restrict access to certain foods for some family members (food taboos). - Poor health services and/or agricultural infrastructure. - Lack of institutional capacity in nutrition and/or personnel trained in the various components of community nutrition programs. - Low production of diversified nutritious foods. - Lack of household level gardening. - Insufficient marketing infrastructure for key food. - Poorly developed commercial food processing industry. Basic causes include: - Limited livelihood opportunities and unequal economic structure. - Inadequate educational opportunities. - Priorities guiding the allocation of public funding and other resources. - Quality of social and political leadership, e.g., poor economic or physi - cal access to markets. - Little or no productive land. - High prevalence of certain endemic diseases, e.g., tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. - Low status of and lack of resource control by women. - Failure to consider nutrition needs in agriculture and health poli - cy-making. - Lack of resources to produce nutrient-rich foods. - Poor economic or physical access to markets. - Little or no productive land. - Lack of access to safe water for drinking, hygiene and/or irrigation.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 6) 51 B) NUTRITION SENSITIVE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION PRACTICES ...................... 53 C) NUTRITION CONSIDERATIONS IN HARVEST AND POSTHARVEST HANDLING ....57 Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage ................................................. 58 Cleaning .................................................................................................................. 58 Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest ................................................................................................. 58 Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods ....59 Distribution ............................................................................................................ 59 Household agroprocessing and value addition ...................................................... 59\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers66- Greater use of wooden pallets for drying, natural fibre bags, hermet - ic bags and various categories of insecticides could all help improve the quality of products and their readiness for storage. - Proper produce storage practices. The ideal storage consists of dry, impermeable spaces kept at low temperature. If crops are kept on damp floors or in pits (even in bags) or humidity rises above 80 per - cent, the likelihood of Aspergillus growth and aflatoxin production is very high. - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers. Examples of these farming systems that promote diver - sified production are hedge gardening and kitchen gardening for fruits and vegetables: - It is advisable that food be grown on fertile soils that are rich in nutrients. - Proper timing of planting, weeding, irrigation, pests and disease control and other important farming practices. - Foods rich in protective nutrients (vitamins and minerals) should be produced: These include orange fleshed sweet potato varieties (OFSP which is rich in vitamin A), iron rich beans, carrots rich in vi - tamin A, pumpkin seed rich in zinc, dark green leafy vegetables and fresh fruits rich in vitamins. - Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean. Foods rich in pro- tein from animal source (those which can easily be kept by women or children for consumption or sold in the market to earn cash for household health expenditure without exciting men to resist).

They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18). - Rabbits are very good for nutrition improvement. They multiply very fast, supply high quality body building foods and can easily be reared by children (picture 18). - Zero grazing dairy enterprises especially under women groups. - Built-in food safety nets actions that reduce risks. - Household food processing and preservation technologies that increase availability, access, security and utilization of most deficient nutrients. - Integrating gender and child care considerations in agricultural pro- gram design and implementation. - Encouraging the production, consumption and marketing of staple foods with high nutrition value, e.g., orange fleshed sweet potatoes, iron rich beans, soy beans, foods fortified with micronutrient, e.g., vitamin A fortified oil, vitamin A fortified flour and iron fortified flour. - Giving special considerations for the participation and benefits access to vulnerable people such people living and affected by HIV/ AIDS, diabetes, cancer, infants, pregnant and lactating women, chil - dren, the sick, the elderly, the displaced and the poor. - Integrating nutrition education into agricultural extension programs.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 19) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers8KEY MESSAGE Promote production and consumption of fruits in all households as part of the broad iron deficiency anaemia prevention strategy.- Legumes such as beans, peas, and pigeon peas, among others. - Fruits such as mangoes, oranges, and pineapples, among others. 2) Micronutrients These are required by the body in small amounts and include: vitamins and minerals. Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron bioavailability from plant food sources.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 56) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers45 Picture 13: Washing utensils; an example of proper hygiene practices. - Always boil/reheat left over food thoroughly before eating. Cover well all the foods in the house away from flies and other pests. - Keep the kitchen very neat. - Keep cooked food away from contact with raw food. - Avoid eating mouldy or rotten food. - Avoid taking oil seeds whose skin has been cracked, e.g., ground - nuts, soybeans. - Wash vegetables with plenty of water at least three times before cutting it. - Avoid taking raw or partially cooked foods of animal origin. - All food grains and seeds such as maize and groundnuts should be properly dried and stored in a dry place. Use clean stores for storing foods.

Intercropping or crop rotation is one of the farming systems that has soil health and nutrition benefits. Legumes are ideal for intercropping with other crops because they fix nitrogen in the soil resulting in high yields from improved soil health. Others include: - Agroforestry - Integrated farming systems (animal & plants) - Soil and water conservation practices - Organic/sustainable agriculture 3) Promote use of labour saving technologies. The use of labour saving technologies such as rain water harvesting; use of animal trac- tion (ploughing, carrying manure/ mulch, water, firewood and harvest), improved cooking stoves, planting of woodlots, minimum tillage (use of pesticides and herbicides) will reduce women workload and allow ample time for child care. 4) Control diseases, agricultural chemical and veterinary drug resi - dues associa ted with f ood pr oduction s ystems.

In addition, diseases caused by vectors living in stagnant water and or storage systems (Malaria, schictosomiasis/bilharzia worms, River blindness). - Zoonoses diseases are diseases transmitted from animals to human being. Examples include: tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, rabies, SARS/avian influenza and ebola. Control of these diseases is important because they can be trans - mitted to human beings, imposing on them poor health and atten- dant undesirable nutrition related effects including the disease burden.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 21) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers10WATER-SOLUBLE VITAMINS (CONTINUED) Vitamin B3 (Niacin)Fish, meat, chicken, eggs, whole grain cerealsEnables energy production in the body, supports appetite and central nervous system functions - Dermatitis - Dementia - Diarrhoea Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)Legumes, avocado, dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), whole grains, nuts and seeds, cabbage, banana, liver, chicken, meat, fish, potatoes, water melon, sun flowers seedsFacilitates metabolism and absorption of fats and proteins, promotes red blood cells formation, production of protein and nerve transmitters, antioxidantsTiredness, anaemia, irritability, depression, sore tongue, nausea, muscle twitching, dizziness, dermatitis (skin problem), neuropathy (nerve problem) Vitamin B 12 (cyanocobalamin)Seafood, liver, kidney, heart, whole grains, tuna, yoghurt, eggs, cheese, meat, chickenFormation of red blood cells, affects white blood cells, maintains nerve and gastrointestinal tissueTiredness, anaemia, confusion, numbness, nerve problems, ringing in ears, dementia, memory problems Folic acid Kidney, liver, nuts, legumes, eggs, green vegetables, whole grains, avocado, oranges, fishContributes to synthesis of new red blood cells and gastrointestinal cells, aids cell division and growthDiarrhoea, sore red tongue, anaemia, heartburn, fatigue, confusion, depression and dementia Vitamin C Guavas, sweet pepper, leafy green vegetables, oranges, lemons, tomatoes, most fruitsBuilds healthy bones, teeth and gums, helps fight infection, helps non-heme iron absorption, serves as an antioxidants, helps in protein metabolismBleeding gums, bruise easily, slow heal, anaemia, muscle and joint pain, frequent colds\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 19) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers8KEY MESSAGE Promote production and consumption of fruits in all households as part of the broad iron deficiency anaemia prevention strategy.- Legumes such as beans, peas, and pigeon peas, among others. - Fruits such as mangoes, oranges, and pineapples, among others. 2) Micronutrients These are required by the body in small amounts and include: vitamins and minerals.

Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.\n\n### QUESTION\nIs carrots listed as a vitamin\u2011A rich food in the handbook?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 19) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers8KEY MESSAGE Promote production and consumption of fruits in all households as part of the broad iron deficiency anaemia prevention strategy.- Legumes such as beans, peas, and pigeon peas, among others. - Fruits such as mangoes, oranges, and pineapples, among others. 2) Micronutrients These are required by the body in small amounts and include: vitamins and minerals. Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron bioavailability from plant food sources.\n\n### QUESTION\nIs pumpkin listed as a vitamin\u2011A rich food in the handbook?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Intercropping or crop rotation is one of the farming systems that has soil health and nutrition benefits. Legumes are ideal for intercropping with other crops because they fix nitrogen in the soil resulting in high yields from improved soil health. Others include: - Agroforestry - Integrated farming systems (animal & plants) - Soil and water conservation practices - Organic/sustainable agriculture 3) Promote use of labour saving technologies. The use of labour saving technologies such as rain water harvesting; use of animal trac- tion (ploughing, carrying manure/ mulch, water, firewood and harvest), improved cooking stoves, planting of woodlots, minimum tillage (use of pesticides and herbicides) will reduce women workload and allow ample time for child care. 4) Control diseases, agricultural chemical and veterinary drug resi - dues associa ted with f ood pr oduction s ystems. These diseases can be broadly classified as follows: - Water-associated/waterborne diseases caused by use of contami- nated water from faecal material (cholera) and chemical intoxica- tion. In addition, diseases caused by vectors living in stagnant water and or storage systems (Malaria, schictosomiasis/bilharzia worms, River blindness). - Zoonoses diseases are diseases transmitted from animals to human being. Examples include: tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, rabies, SARS/avian influenza and ebola. Control of these diseases is important because they can be trans - mitted to human beings, imposing on them poor health and atten- dant undesirable nutrition related effects including the disease burden.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 82) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers71Summary of common agricultural projects or actions linked to nutrition - Backyard gardens for fruits, vegetable and herbs strategically placed near the home to enable easy watering using waste water during the dry season (picture 18). - Rearing of small animal and birds such as poultry, fish, goats, pigs, guinea pigs and rabbits that can be reared in the backyard. - Rearing local chickens are quite easy to keep by both women and children. They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18). - Rabbits are very good for nutrition improvement. They multiply very fast, supply high quality body building foods and can easily be reared by children (picture 18). - Zero grazing dairy enterprises especially under women groups. - Built-in food safety nets actions that reduce risks. - Household food processing and preservation technologies that increase availability, access, security and utilization of most deficient nutrients. - Integrating gender and child care considerations in agricultural pro- gram design and implementation. - Encouraging the production, consumption and marketing of staple foods with high nutrition value, e.g., orange fleshed sweet potatoes, iron rich beans, soy beans, foods fortified with micronutrient, e.g., vitamin A fortified oil, vitamin A fortified flour and iron fortified flour. - Giving special considerations for the participation and benefits access to vulnerable people such people living and affected by HIV/ AIDS, diabetes, cancer, infants, pregnant and lactating women, chil - dren, the sick, the elderly, the displaced and the poor. - Integrating nutrition education into agricultural extension programs.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 22) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers11FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS Vitamin A (Retinol)Yellow/orange fruits and vegetables, DGLV, egg yolk, liver, milk, blue-band/ margarineSupports immune system and provides resistance to infections, ensures good vision, healthy skin, teeth and bone development, promotes maintenance of epithelial cells and mucous membranesEye problems and night blindness, sensitivity to light, scaly and skin and hair, poor teeth and nails, colds Vitamin D Produced by the skin on exposure to sunlight Milk, cheese, butter, blue band margarine, fatty fish eggs and liverRequired for proper formation of bone and teeth Helps the body to absorb calcium and phosphorusPoor absorption of iron and phosphorus will lead to formation of weak bones and teeth, growth of children is retarded severe deficiency leads to rickets and osteomalacia in adults/elderly Vitamin E Vegetable oils, nuts and seeds, whole grains, eggs, legumes, DGLVIncreases disease resistance, Protects fats and vitamins A and C from oxidation, prevents agingTiredness, dry hair, leg cramps, infertility, muscle weakness, impotence, nerve problems and heart disorders Vitamin K Vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, cauliflower, and cabbage, broccoli, fish, liver, meat, eggsHelps with blood clottingBleeding\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 82) - Encouraging the production, consumption and marketing of staple foods with high nutrition value, e.g., orange fleshed sweet potatoes, iron rich beans, soy beans, foods fortified with micronutrient, e.g., vitamin A fortified oil, vitamin A fortified flour and iron fortified flour. - Giving special considerations for the participation and benefits access to vulnerable people such people living and affected by HIV/ AIDS, diabetes, cancer, infants, pregnant and lactating women, chil - dren, the sick, the elderly, the displaced and the poor. - Integrating nutrition education into agricultural extension programs.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day.

However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango).

Intercropping or crop rotation is one of the farming systems that has soil health and nutrition benefits. Legumes are ideal for intercropping with other crops because they fix nitrogen in the soil resulting in high yields from improved soil health. Others include: - Agroforestry - Integrated farming systems (animal & plants) - Soil and water conservation practices - Organic/sustainable agriculture 3) Promote use of labour saving technologies. The use of labour saving technologies such as rain water harvesting; use of animal trac- tion (ploughing, carrying manure/ mulch, water, firewood and harvest), improved cooking stoves, planting of woodlots, minimum tillage (use of pesticides and herbicides) will reduce women workload and allow ample time for child care. 4) Control diseases, agricultural chemical and veterinary drug resi - dues associa ted with f ood pr oduction s ystems. These diseases can be broadly classified as follows: - Water-associated/waterborne diseases caused by use of contami- nated water from faecal material (cholera) and chemical intoxica- tion. In addition, diseases caused by vectors living in stagnant water and or storage systems (Malaria, schictosomiasis/bilharzia worms, River blindness). - Zoonoses diseases are diseases transmitted from animals to human being. Examples include: tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, rabies, SARS/avian influenza and ebola. Control of these diseases is important because they can be trans - mitted to human beings, imposing on them poor health and atten- dant undesirable nutrition related effects including the disease burden.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 14) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers3 Figure 3: Examples of locally available vegetables and fruits which are rich sources of vitamins and mineralsc) Protective (\u201cGLOW\u201d foods) Foods rich in minerals and vitamins are known as protective or \u201cGLOW\u201d foods. They are essential for promoting body immunity and regulatory functions. Fruits and vegetables are the main sources of \u201cGLOW\u201d foods.

They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition and income generation. - The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris- tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 18). - Rabbits are very good for nutrition improvement. They multiply very fast, supply high quality body building foods and can easily be reared by children (picture 18). - Zero grazing dairy enterprises especially under women groups. - Built-in food safety nets actions that reduce risks. - Household food processing and preservation technologies that increase availability, access, security and utilization of most deficient nutrients. - Integrating gender and child care considerations in agricultural pro- gram design and implementation. - Encouraging the production, consumption and marketing of staple foods with high nutrition value, e.g., orange fleshed sweet potatoes, iron rich beans, soy beans, foods fortified with micronutrient, e.g., vitamin A fortified oil, vitamin A fortified flour and iron fortified flour. - Giving special considerations for the participation and benefits access to vulnerable people such people living and affected by HIV/ AIDS, diabetes, cancer, infants, pregnant and lactating women, chil - dren, the sick, the elderly, the displaced and the poor. - Integrating nutrition education into agricultural extension programs.\n\n### QUESTION\nIs oranges listed as a vitamin\u2011A rich food in the handbook?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 85) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers74Vitamin/Mineral Source RDAaIts function in the body Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)Whole-grain products ,poultry, fish, and nuts; also meat, most fruits and vegetables, eggs and dairy products1.6 - 2 mg Metabolizes protein; helps produce haemoglobin; promotes functioning of digestive and nervous systems, and healthy skin.

Reten- tion of physical and nutritional qualities of agricultural produce can be ensured by developing appropriate and improved postharvest handling, storage and cooking. This keeps consumers healthier and improves the marketability of farm produce. Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage - Harvest food at the right stage of maturity to ensure maximum nutrient availability, e.g., most fruits and vegetables have greater vitamin content if they are picked ripe from the plant, rather than being picked before they have fully ripened. - Over ripening of fruits will reduce the nutritional quality of fruits. - Avoid physical and mechanical damages during harvesting to ensure longer storage and safe food following the harvest. - Early planting prevents nuts from maturing during periods of low rainfall, which stresses a plant and encourages growth of the fungus on ripening crops. Cleaning - Drying of produce should be done on a clean and dry surface to avoid moisture and reduce the risk of contamination. As much as possible tarpaulins should be used. - It is recommended that drying is done on a raised platform, one (1) meter above the ground to reduce contamination from animals passing by. Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest - Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 71) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers60SUMMARY - Minimize storage losses attributable to harvesting, weevils and farm processing. - Harvest food at the right stage of maturity (avoid harvesting immature or over-mature produce in case of fruits don\u2019t har - vest under ripe or over ripe ones). - Avoid physical or mechanical damage during harvesting, transportation and handling of foods. - Avoid drying, shelling, threshing and winnowing food on bare ground (problems with contamination by microorganisms, sand and stones). - Sort and clean the food to remove diseased and poor quality produce and impurities. - Make sure that the produce is prepared under hygienic condi - tions all the time. - Recommended storage practices are very important for both perishables (fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, poultry and eggs) and non-perishables like cereals and legumes). - Maintain hygienic environment wherever food is produced and handled. - Practice appropriate food preservation in homes, e.g., drying, smoking or salting of meat and fish, preservation of fruits and vegetables by use of solar drying. - Discourage processing practices that contaminate the agricul- ture harvest. - Promote good storage practices that ensure safe and nutri - tious foods. - Not all food should go to the market. - Use income from non-food items to buy food.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 19) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers8KEY MESSAGE Promote production and consumption of fruits in all households as part of the broad iron deficiency anaemia prevention strategy.- Legumes such as beans, peas, and pigeon peas, among others. - Fruits such as mangoes, oranges, and pineapples, among others. 2) Micronutrients These are required by the body in small amounts and include: vitamins and minerals. Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron bioavailability from plant food sources.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers59- Clean and sort to remove broken kernels, foreign matter, and diseased and rotten foods (grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables); these attract mois - ture and pests leading to spoilage and/or fungal growth. - Ensure crops are properly dried immediately after harvesting; howev - er, drying will not reverse the effect of poison in the already contam- inated foods, but it may inhibit further growth of moulds and other microbes. Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced. For example, containers should be clean and dry. Household agroprocessing and value addition - Household or on-farm processing gives food security and nutrition benefits in addition to higher, potentially stable and regular incomes. - Simple/hand coffee processing tools will ensure that coffee husks remain and act as manure for crop enterprises. - Many foods that are transported to the urban centres and other markets in their very fresh forms result in considerable soil nutrient mining of the production areas and burdening of the waste disposal systems in the target markets. A case in point is the banana market in Uganda. KEY MESSAGE Promote household/cottage level agriculture value addition for better incomes and as part of sustainable agricultural production systems for improving food security and nutrition.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers65Livestock production - When animals have been treated with veterinary drugs, the drug withdrawal period for each drug should be observed before the an- imals are sold for slaughter or the animal products such as milk are released for human consumption. - The farmer should consult a veterinary doctor for guidance. If the animals or animal products are released for human consumption before the drug withdrawal period is over, the drug or its metabo - lites is still in the animal/animal product and when consumed may lead to drug resistance in human or failure to respond usual human drug treatment. - Animal products are highly perishable and germs easily multiply in them so should be properly handled and cooked before consump - tion. - Provide information/guidelines on the effect of poor handling of produce to various players throughout the value chain and how it can be prevented. Sustained public awareness campaigns are essential in order to improve the situation. Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus. - After harvest, the moisture content of produce must be dried to 12 to 14 percent for safe storage with minimum deterioration. - Reducing drought stress through irrigation and limiting insect dam - age by the application of good agricultural and pest control practic- es, including use of high quality seeds is essential. - Rapid drying limits aflatoxin proliferation for example, the piling of maize in stacks in the field extends drying time and therefore the potential for aflatoxins to be produced during the drying process. Wet-shelling of groundnuts prior to drying can also promote mould growth.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 57) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers46Picture 14: Food hygiene and safety is one of the main ways of preventing infections: washing fruits before slicing and eating them. Note: also a clean and well organized kitchen. Kitchen and housekeeping - The kitchen and house should be kept clean because it can be a seri- ous cause of food contamination if it is not well tended to. - The inside of the house should be kept neat and invitingly well orga-nized/arranged to allow thorough cleaning. - The kitchen should have a door for the safety of the items kept there. - Keep the inside of the house tidy by regular cleaning. - It should have good ventilation to avoid growth of fungi and mould. - There should be a simple rubbish bin for putting in refuse before disposal into the compost pit. The rubbish bin should have a cover. - Use fuel saving stoves. - Do not sleep with animals in the same house. - If the house is not cemented, it should be smeared at least once a month.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 22) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers11FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS Vitamin A (Retinol)Yellow/orange fruits and vegetables, DGLV, egg yolk, liver, milk, blue-band/ margarineSupports immune system and provides resistance to infections, ensures good vision, healthy skin, teeth and bone development, promotes maintenance of epithelial cells and mucous membranesEye problems and night blindness, sensitivity to light, scaly and skin and hair, poor teeth and nails, colds Vitamin D Produced by the skin on exposure to sunlight Milk, cheese, butter, blue band margarine, fatty fish eggs and liverRequired for proper formation of bone and teeth Helps the body to absorb calcium and phosphorusPoor absorption of iron and phosphorus will lead to formation of weak bones and teeth, growth of children is retarded severe deficiency leads to rickets and osteomalacia in adults/elderly Vitamin E Vegetable oils, nuts and seeds, whole grains, eggs, legumes, DGLVIncreases disease resistance, Protects fats and vitamins A and C from oxidation, prevents agingTiredness, dry hair, leg cramps, infertility, muscle weakness, impotence, nerve problems and heart disorders Vitamin K Vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, cauliflower, and cabbage, broccoli, fish, liver, meat, eggsHelps with blood clottingBleeding\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 55) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers44 Picture 12: Making drinking water safe through boiling and keeping drink water covered and safe, cover water containers, wash hands after visiting toilet and always wash fruits before giving to child.- All drinking water should be boiled including water harvested from iron sheet-roofed houses and from the trees. Hand washing If done properly and at critical times, washing hands with soap or an abrasive substance such as is effective in preventing diarrhoea. Food hygiene Although statistics of food borne illnesses are scanty in Uganda, many people die as a result of diarrhoea disease cases. These are attributed to contaminated food or water, universal precautions apply to food handling like washing of raw fruits and vegetables. Good practices to improve food hygiene - Wash hands thoroughly before handling, preparing and eating food. - Wash the knives, chopping boards and all surfaces thoroughly with clean water before and after use. - Prepare and serve food when hot or warm.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 66) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers55ies for the selected strategic enterprises, e.g., vitamin A and protein rich maize, iron rich beans, vitamin A rich bananas and cassava. 2) Ado ption of f arming s ystems tha t c onserve the en vironment and promote nutrition. Intercropping or crop rotation is one of the farming systems that has soil health and nutrition benefits. Legumes are ideal for intercropping with other crops because they fix nitrogen in the soil resulting in high yields from improved soil health. Others include: - Agroforestry - Integrated farming systems (animal & plants) - Soil and water conservation practices - Organic/sustainable agriculture 3) Promote use of labour saving technologies. The use of labour saving technologies such as rain water harvesting; use of animal trac- tion (ploughing, carrying manure/ mulch, water, firewood and harvest), improved cooking stoves, planting of woodlots, minimum tillage (use of pesticides and herbicides) will reduce women workload and allow ample time for child care. 4) Control diseases, agricultural chemical and veterinary drug resi - dues associa ted with f ood pr oduction s ystems. These diseases can be broadly classified as follows: - Water-associated/waterborne diseases caused by use of contami- nated water from faecal material (cholera) and chemical intoxica- tion. In addition, diseases caused by vectors living in stagnant water and or storage systems (Malaria, schictosomiasis/bilharzia worms, River blindness). - Zoonoses diseases are diseases transmitted from animals to human being. Examples include: tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, rabies, SARS/avian influenza and ebola. Control of these diseases is important because they can be trans - mitted to human beings, imposing on them poor health and atten- dant undesirable nutrition related effects including the disease burden.\n\n### QUESTION\nTrue or False: The handbook recommends harvesting fruits before they are fully ripe to maximize vitamin content.\n\n### ANSWER\n",
