Foods are selected from each of the groups according to the required servings. - Plan several meals in advance.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 39) Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 41) - Plan several meals in advance. - Consider foods available according to season. - Take off time to look for affordable places to buy food to reduce on expenditure.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 41) - Avoid foods which are poor value for money such as food containing only energy, e.g., sodas and many artificial soft drinks. - Except for special occasions, plan several meals at least a week before. - Within a week or the day take advantage of opportunities when food supply is plentiful and cheap.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 43) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers32 Picture 6: Examples of a variety of the locally available foods from the three main food groupsAn example of a mixed meal guide to achieve a balanced diet SUMMARY - Eat a lot of whole cereals and beans or legumes generally, if you can\u2019t afford animal protein and as much as possible take some milk in your meals. - Eat a variety of food types from different main three groups (energy giving, body building and protective foods) at a very meal. - For lunch and supper take a fruit and a serving of vegetables (100g or one handful of fresh vegetables).\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 95) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers84- If necessary, increase the amount of food and the number of meals that the child eats. - Increase the length of time between breast feeds, so that the num - ber of breast feeds decreases gradually. - Apart from those times when you decide to breastfeed, avoid situa - tions that make the child think of breastfeeding for example, having the child on her lap if she sits down to eat or to have a drink.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 63) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers52youth is critical in building the next generation of agricultural leaders and thus creates sustainable change in the community. Nutrition and agricultur e in formation sharing: During planning ensure that farmer groups provide a forum to discuss nutrition issues; groups can set rules ensuring all members practice essential nutrition actions (refer to chapter 3). Groups can buy labour saving technologies to address the issues of labour and child care; and empower farmers to demand for appropriate nutrition advice and information.\n\n### QUESTION\nList two points to consider while planning a meal, according to the handbook.\n\n### ANSWER\n",

This form of malnutrition cannot be identi- fied easily except in advanced stages when clinical signs appear. Minerals and vitamins are required by the body in very small quantities, they are very important in protecting the body against infections.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 32) - Poor access to healthcare and inadequate water and sanitation, leading to increased illness. - Inadequate and/or incorrect feeding practices. - Inadequate caring capacity for example inadequate time, inade - quate knowledge.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency). Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: - Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age - Non-breastfed children - Pregnant and lactating women - People suffering from chronic or infectious disease - People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n### QUESTION\nIs 'poor access to healthcare' identified as an underlying cause of malnutrition in the handbook?

Exclusive breastfeeding refers to feeding a child on breast milk only for the first six months. Mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies as many times as the baby demands to be fed (at least 8 times a day, every 2-3 hours).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 49) SUMMARY - Exclusive breastfeeding is the safest and healthiest way to feed a baby for the first 6 months. - Babies need to be breastfed 8-12 times a day after every 2-3 hours or more as needed, in the first six months. - Mothers should continue to breast feed their babies up to the age of 2 years or more even after introducing complemen- tary feeding (weaning).\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 49) - Helps the mother to shrink the uterus back to its normal size. - Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months helps a child\u2019s mental (brain) development.

Alongside breast milk at the age of six months, beyond 6 months, breast milk alone is not enough to meet the child\u2019s increased nutritional needs for proper growth and development. During weaning there are six princi - ples to follow: meal frequency, amount, thickness, variety, active feeding and hygiene.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 47) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers36 Picture 7: A pregnant woman and a breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the food groups, extra meals and take iron and folate daily.

Breast - feeding women need to eat a wide variety of foods.

Promotion of market oriented agriculture has resulted in increased production; however limited emphasis has been placed on reducing postharvest losses and increasing shelf life to ensure availability during lean periods.\n\n### QUESTION\nIs quinoa classified as a staple cereal in the handbook?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 34) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 29) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.

Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 29) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 34) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 29) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.

Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.

Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 34) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 29) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 34) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 29) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk. When severe, presents with visible wasting (promi - nence of bones) and/or symmetrical swelling of the body starting from both feet. 2) Chronic malnutrition: Stunting A child\u2019s height is one of the most important indicator of his/her well- being.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhat is one immediate consequence of malnutrition mentioned in the handbook?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 34) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 29) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.

Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.

Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 34) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 29) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 34) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 29) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.

Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.

Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 34) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 29) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, underlying cause and basic causes. Immediate causes include: - Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems). - Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc - tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension. - Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 38) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY - Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition. - Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri - tion and micronutrient deficiencies. - Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub - optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 34) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23 Causes of Malnutrition: Conceptual Framework: Determinants of Malnutrition Disease Inadequate Care an d Feeding Practices MATERNAL AND CHILD MALNUTRITION Inadequate Dietary Intake Household Food Insecurity Unhealthy Household Environment and Inadequate Health Services Household access to adequate quantity and quality of resources: land, education, em ployment, income, technology IMMEDIATE causes UNDERLYING causes BASIC causes Inadequate financial, human, physical and social capital Sociocultural, economic and political context Short -term consequences: Mortality, morbidity, disability Long -term c onsequences: Cognitive ability, economic productivity, reproductive performance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease Figure 2. The conceptual framework showing the causes of malnutrition (Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 28) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections. - More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition. - Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe malnutrition.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences (cost) of malnutrition a) Consequences of undernutrition Child deaths, diseases and disability - Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born with a healthy weight. - A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008). - A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 35) - Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im- pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda. Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system - Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee - ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency) - Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys- tem (folic acid deficiency) - Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg - nancy) - Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth - When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers. - Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 36) - Cost of caring for sick. - Lost care for other (not sick) household members. b) Consequences of overnutrition Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including: - Coronary heart disease (heart attack) - Diabetes (high blood sugar) - Gout (swollen painful joints) - Hypertension (high blood pressure) - Overweight - Obesity - Death Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different infections.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 29) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers 181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss of muscles in bulk.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.

Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 8) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain.\n\n[4] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 77) - Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. - Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.\n\n[5] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 61) Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops. Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground - nuts should also be prevented. It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.\n\n[6] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 75) - Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as - sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda. Action areas for extension workers and others on food safety - Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, transportation and preparation of food. - Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man - ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.\n\n[7] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 70) Promote good storage practices to protect the nutrient content of the foods - Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air - flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods. Distribution - Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re - duced.\n\n[8] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 76) Food quality along the value chain right from production through marketing to consump - tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda. Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in foods - Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 64) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53- Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as - sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, bilharzias and others). - Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas- es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other vulnerable groups along the value chain activities. SUMMARY - Train farmers to articulate their nutrition related needs during the planning process.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhat food processing practice helps prevent aflatoxin contamination according to the handbook?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers.\n\n[9] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits.\n\n[10] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhich small livestock animal is suggested for backyard rearing to improve household protein intake?\n\n### ANSWER\n",
